## Overview

The [CISA SBOM Sharing Lifecycle Report](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/sbom-sharing-lifecycle-report_508.pdf) focuses on operational aspects of SBOM distribution rather than adding new data fields. It defines the SBOM sharing lifecycle as three phases: **Discovery** (locating SBOMs), **Access** (authorization and retrieval), and **Transport** (delivery mechanisms).

This report does not prescribe additional SBOM properties but provides guidance on infrastructure and processes needed for effective SBOM sharing across the supply chain.

## The Three Phases

### 1. Discovery

How do consumers find out that an SBOM exists and where to get it?

- Discoverability mechanisms for locating SBOMs
- Metadata and pointers that indicate SBOM availability

### 2. Access

Who is allowed to retrieve the SBOM and how is authorization managed?

- Authorization and access control patterns
- Public vs. private SBOM distribution models
- Role-based access considerations

### 3. Transport

How are SBOMs physically delivered from producer to consumer?

- Repository portals and package registries
- APIs for SBOM retrieval
- Out-of-band delivery mechanisms (email, secure file transfer)
- Enrichment workflows where downstream consumers add information and re-share

## Key Concepts

- **Discoverability mechanisms** for locating SBOMs
- **Authorization and access control patterns** for managing who can retrieve SBOMs
- **Transport protocols and sharing patterns** (repository portals, APIs, out-of-band delivery)
- **Enrichment workflows** where downstream consumers add information and re-share

## Practical Applications

This report is valuable for:

- Organizations setting up SBOM distribution infrastructure
- Procurement teams defining SBOM delivery requirements in contracts
- Security teams designing SBOM ingestion workflows
