## Source vs Build SBOMs

Dart's package manager (pub) provides excellent lockfile support through `pubspec.lock`. This makes source SBOM generation reliable for both Dart and Flutter projects.

- **Source SBOMs** are generated from `pubspec.lock`
- **Build SBOMs** can be generated from the `.dart_tool/package_config.json`

For most Dart/Flutter projects, generating from `pubspec.lock` is preferred because it contains exact resolved versions and content hashes.

## Lockfile Deep Dive

### pubspec.yaml (Manifest)

The `pubspec.yaml` file declares your dependencies:

```yaml
name: my_app
description: A sample Dart/Flutter application
version: 1.0.0

environment:
  sdk: '>=3.0.0 <4.0.0'
  flutter: '>=3.16.0'

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  http: ^1.2.0
  provider: ^6.1.0
  shared_preferences: ^2.2.0

dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_lints: ^3.0.0
  build_runner: ^2.4.0
```

### pubspec.lock

The `pubspec.lock` file contains resolved dependencies:

```yaml
# Generated by pub
# See https://dart.dev/tools/pub/glossary#lockfile
packages:
  http:
    dependency: "direct main"
    description:
      name: http
      sha256: "761a297c042deedc1ffbb156d6e2f13c3eb84c6cf7cb8dc2d5f2d5b0b8cb9c7b"
      url: "https://pub.dev"
    source: hosted
    version: "1.2.0"
  http_parser:
    dependency: transitive
    description:
      name: http_parser
      sha256: "2aa08ce0341cc9b354a498388e30986515406668dbcc4f7c950c3e715496693b"
      url: "https://pub.dev"
    source: hosted
    version: "4.0.2"
  provider:
    dependency: "direct main"
    description:
      name: provider
      sha256: "7e4a68b2a6e459ff1a3ce8a35c79cd2ad9b96742e5a81c8a83e1d7e3e9c27f22"
      url: "https://pub.dev"
    source: hosted
    version: "6.1.1"
sdks:
  dart: ">=3.0.0 <4.0.0"
  flutter: ">=3.16.0"
```

Key information:

- **dependency**: "direct main", "direct dev", or "transitive"
- **sha256**: Content hash for integrity verification
- **source**: "hosted" (pub.dev), "git", or "path"
- **version**: Exact resolved version

## Flutter-Specific Dependencies

Flutter projects have additional dependency types:

### Flutter SDK Dependencies

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_localizations:
    sdk: flutter
```

These are part of the Flutter SDK and typically not included in SBOMs as they're versioned with Flutter itself.

### Platform-Specific Dependencies

Flutter plugins may have native dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  url_launcher: ^6.2.0  # Has iOS/Android native code
  sqflite: ^2.3.0       # SQLite bindings
```

The native code dependencies aren't captured in `pubspec.lock`. Consider documenting them separately.

## Generating an SBOM

SBOM generation is the first step in the [SBOM lifecycle](/features/generate-collaborate-analyze/). After generation, you typically need to enrich your SBOM with package metadata and augment it with your organization's details.

### Using sbomify GitHub Action (Recommended)

The [sbomify GitHub Action](https://github.com/sbomify/github-action/) is a swiss army knife for SBOMs that automatically selects the best generation tool for your ecosystem, enriches the output with package metadata, and optionally augments it with your business information—all in one step.

For Dart/Flutter, sbomify uses **cdxgen** or **Syft** under the hood (Trivy doesn't support Dart).

**Standalone (no account needed):**

```yaml
- uses: sbomify/github-action@master
  env:
    LOCK_FILE: pubspec.lock
    OUTPUT_FILE: sbom.cdx.json
    COMPONENT_NAME: my-flutter-app
    COMPONENT_VERSION: ${{ github.ref_name }}
    ENRICH: true
    UPLOAD: false
```

Using `github.ref_name` automatically captures your git tag (e.g., `v1.2.3`) as the SBOM version. For rolling releases without tags, use `github.sha` instead. See our [SBOM versioning guide](/guides/how-to-version-sboms/) for best practices.

**With sbomify platform (adds augmentation and upload):**

```yaml
- uses: sbomify/github-action@master
  env:
    TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SBOMIFY_TOKEN }}
    COMPONENT_ID: my-component-id
    LOCK_FILE: pubspec.lock
    OUTPUT_FILE: sbom.cdx.json
    AUGMENT: true
    ENRICH: true
```

### Alternative Tools

If you prefer to run SBOM generation tools manually:

**cdxgen (recommended for manual use):**

```bash
npm install -g @cyclonedx/cdxgen
cdxgen -t dart -o sbom.cdx.json
```

**Syft:**

```bash
syft . -o cyclonedx-json=sbom.cdx.json
```

**sbom (Dart-native, SPDX only):**

```bash
dart pub add --dev sbom
```

Note: The `sbom` Dart package currently only supports SPDX format, not CycloneDX.

Trivy currently has limited Dart support. Use cdxgen or Syft for CycloneDX output.

When using these tools directly, you'll need to handle enrichment and augmentation separately.

### GitLab CI

```yaml
generate-sbom:
  image: sbomifyhub/sbomify-action
  variables:
    LOCK_FILE: pubspec.lock
    OUTPUT_FILE: sbom.cdx.json
    UPLOAD: "false"
    ENRICH: "true"
  script:
    - /sbomify.sh
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - sbom.cdx.json
```

## Handling Special Cases

### Git Dependencies

Packages from Git repositories:

```yaml
dependencies:
  my_package:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/example/my_package.git
      ref: v1.0.0
```

In `pubspec.lock`:

```yaml
my_package:
  dependency: "direct main"
  description:
    path: "."
    ref: v1.0.0
    resolved-ref: "abc123def456..."
    url: "https://github.com/example/my_package.git"
  source: git
  version: "1.0.0"
```

### Path Dependencies

Local packages:

```yaml
dependencies:
  my_local_package:
    path: ../my_local_package
```

These won't have pub.dev metadata. Document them with `ADDITIONAL_PACKAGES` if needed.

### Hosted Dependencies (Private)

For private package servers:

```yaml
dependencies:
  my_private_package:
    hosted:
      name: my_private_package
      url: https://packages.example.com
    version: ^1.0.0
```

Ensure your CI has authentication configured:

```bash
# Set up authentication
dart pub token add https://packages.example.com
```

## Monorepo Support (Melos)

For Dart/Flutter monorepos using [Melos](https://melos.invertase.dev/):

```yaml
# melos.yaml
name: my_workspace
packages:
  - packages/*
  - apps/*
```

Generate SBOMs per package or use Melos to run across all:

```bash
melos exec -- "cdxgen -t dart -o sbom.cdx.json"
```

## pub.dev Metadata Enrichment

pub.dev provides rich metadata for packages:

- License information
- Repository URLs
- Author information
- Documentation links

When using `ENRICH: true`, this metadata is added to your SBOM automatically.

## Best Practices

1. **Always commit pubspec.lock** - Essential for reproducible builds
2. **Use caret syntax carefully** - `^1.0.0` allows minor/patch updates
3. **Pin versions for production** - Consider exact versions for releases
4. **Separate dev dependencies** - Keep test/build tools in `dev_dependencies`
5. **Document native dependencies** - Flutter plugins have native code not in pubspec
6. **Run `dart pub outdated`** - Check for updates regularly

## Security Considerations

```bash
# Check for vulnerable packages
dart pub deps --json | jq '.packages[].name' # Export for scanning

# Use Flutter's built-in checks
flutter pub outdated
```

Combine dependency checks with SBOM generation in CI:

```yaml
- name: Check dependencies
  run: dart pub outdated --json > outdated.json

- name: Generate SBOM
  uses: sbomify/github-action@master
  env:
    LOCK_FILE: 'pubspec.lock'
    OUTPUT_FILE: 'sbom.cdx.json'
    ENRICH: true
```
