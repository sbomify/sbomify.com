## Overview

The **EU Cyber Resilience Act** (Regulation 2024/2847) is a binding EU regulation that establishes cybersecurity requirements for products with digital elements — essentially any hardware or software product sold in the EU market.

It was published in the Official Journal of the EU in November 2024, with a phased enforcement timeline through 2027.

## Key SBOM requirements

The CRA explicitly requires manufacturers to:

- **Produce an SBOM** identifying components and dependencies in their products
- **Document vulnerabilities** and provide timely security updates
- **Report actively exploited vulnerabilities** to ENISA within 24 hours
- **Maintain cybersecurity** throughout the product's expected lifetime

The SBOM must cover at minimum the top-level dependencies of the product. The exact depth requirements are being further specified through harmonized standards.

## Who does it apply to?

The CRA applies to:

- Software vendors selling products in the EU (including SaaS with on-premise components)
- Hardware manufacturers with embedded software
- Open-source projects distributed commercially (though non-commercial open source has exemptions)

## Timeline

- **September 2026** — Vulnerability reporting obligations begin
- **September 2027** — Full compliance required for all products
