## Uploading compliance documents

sbomify lets you attach compliance documents -such as SOC 2 Type II reports, ISO 27001 certificates, CE certificates, and other attestations -directly to your projects. This keeps your compliance artifacts alongside your SBOMs in one place.

To upload a compliance document:

1. Navigate to your **Project**
2. Go to the **Documents** section
3. Click **Upload Document**
4. Select the file and fill in the document details
5. Click **Save**

Uploaded documents are visible to anyone with access to the project and can be shared via your [Trust Center](/faq/what-is-a-trust-center/).
