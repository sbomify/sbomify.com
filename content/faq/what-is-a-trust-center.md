## What is a Trust Center?

A Trust Center is a dedicated page where your organization publicly shares security and compliance information about your products. Instead of handling security questionnaires and SBOM requests ad-hoc via email, you provide a single URL where customers and partners can find everything they need.

A Trust Center typically includes:

- **SBOMs** - Current Software Bill of Materials for your products
- **Compliance status** - Which frameworks and standards you meet
- **Security attestations** - Signed statements about your security practices
- **Vulnerability disclosures** - How you handle and communicate security issues

## Why does it matter?

Enterprise buyers and regulated industries increasingly require evidence of security practices during procurement. A Trust Center:

- **Reduces friction** - Customers self-serve instead of sending questionnaires
- **Scales trust** - One page serves all customers, partners, and auditors
- **Demonstrates maturity** - Shows you take supply chain security seriously
- **Meets compliance requirements** - CRA and other regulations require transparency about software composition

## sbomify's Trust Center

sbomify includes a built-in Trust Center on the Business and Enterprise plans that automatically publishes your uploaded SBOMs and compliance artifacts. You can see a live example at [trust.sbomify.com](https://trust.sbomify.com/) - that's sbomify's own Trust Center, built with the same feature available to Business and Enterprise users.

Key features:

- **Automatic updates** - When you upload a new SBOM, your Trust Center reflects it immediately
- **Custom domain** - Map your Trust Center to your own domain (e.g., trust.yourcompany.com)
- **Granular access** - Choose which artifacts are public vs. private
- **Compliance badges** - Show which standards your products meet

## Getting started

1. [Sign up for sbomify](https://app.sbomify.com) on a Business or Enterprise plan
2. Upload your SBOMs
3. Configure your Trust Center settings
4. Optionally map it to your own domain
5. Share the URL with customers

No additional hosting is required - sbomify handles everything.
