The SBOM life cycle can be broken down into three phases: [generation, distribution, and analysis]({{ site.url }}/features/generate-collaborate-analyze/). The structure below aligns with the life cycle.

There's also a GitHub repository called [sbom-benchmarks](https://github.com/sbomify/sbom-benchmarks) that sets to benchmark the various tools (from the Generation phase) against each other, along with providing examples how they are used.

## Generation / Authoring

The SBOM generation phase, also known as authoring, is where you create an SBOM from a source. There are various strategies for generating SBOMs, but this phase generally involves taking a set of inputs (such as a dependency file) and generating an SBOM in either the [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) or [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/) format.

### Generic

Tools that spans multiple formats and languages.

### Specific

Language or format-specific tools.

#### Docker / Containers

You can see how they compare side-by-side in the [sbom-benchmark](https://github.com/sbomify/sbom-benchmarks/tree/master/docker) repository.

## Distribution / Transportation

The distribution phase, also known as Transportation, focuses on how you share the SBOM with internal and external stakeholders.

- [Project Koala](https://github.com/CycloneDX/transparency-exchange-api) (a.k.a. Transparency Exchange API) from CycloneDX

## Analysis

The analysis phase involves how you use the SBOM, typically for compliance or security purposes. Mature organizations may use multiple tools or services for different purposes.
