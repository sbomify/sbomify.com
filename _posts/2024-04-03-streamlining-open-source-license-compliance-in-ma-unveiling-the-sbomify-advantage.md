In the intricate arena of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) within the tech industry, the due diligence process is paramount, especially when evaluating the acquisition of software companies. One of the significant challenges encountered is navigating the complexities of open source licenses, which, if not thoroughly understood and managed, can introduce unforeseen complications. Licenses such as the GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3) along with other non-permissive licenses pose specific challenges due to their requirements, which might restrict the proprietary use of software. This is where sbomify emerges as a crucial tool, offering an innovative solution to effortlessly identify and manage these licenses.

### The Challenge at Hand

The integration of open source software (OSS) into commercial products is a common practice due to its benefits such as reduced development costs and accelerated innovation. However, the diversity of open source licenses, from permissive to non-permissive, necessitates meticulous management to ensure compliance. Non-permissive licenses, including GPLv3, AGPL, and LGPL, require that modifications to the open source code be made publicly available under the same license, potentially affecting proprietary software integration. In the context of M&A, identifying such licenses early in the due diligence process is critical to avoid legal and operational risks.
