We’re excited to announce the release of version [0.3.0](https://github.com/sbomify/github-action/releases/tag/v0.3.0) of our [GitHub Actions module](https://github.com/sbomify/github-action)!

This update brings some valuable enhancements, including:

- **GitLab support:** Responding to popular demand, you can now use our sbomify toolkit with GitLab, making it easier than ever to integrate SBOM generation into your GitLab CI/CD workflows. Check out the details [here](https://github.com/sbomify/github-action#using-in-gitlab).
- **Improved speed:** We’ve optimized the toolchain to reduce build times by **50%** or more, even on high-performance servers.
- **Bug fixes:** This release includes fixes for issues encountered when building SBOMs from Docker images, ensuring a smoother experience.
