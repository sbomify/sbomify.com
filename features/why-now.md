title: The Growing Importance of SBOMs in Cybersecurity Compliance
---

The cybersecurity landscape has evolved rapidly in recent years, driven largely by increased awareness of software supply chain vulnerabilities. A significant milestone in this evolution was the US government's introduction of [Executive Order 14028](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/05/17/2021-10460/improving-the-nations-cybersecurity) in May 2021. This executive order responded directly to escalating cyber threats targeting critical infrastructure, government agencies, and private enterprises. One of its key components mandated Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) for all vendors selling software to the federal government.

This SBOM mandate has profoundly impacted the entire software industry. SBOMs provide detailed documentation of software components and are now recognized as essential tools for ensuring supply chain transparency and security. The requirement's cascading effect is particularly evident in compliance-related areas, where major regulatory frameworks and standards bodies increasingly incorporate SBOM requirements into their guidelines.

A prime example is the EU's Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), which has established these firm implementation dates:

- Goes into force: **December 10, 2024** (<span id="force-countdown" class="font-bold"></span>)
- Mandatory reporting begins: **September 11, 2026** (<span id="reporting-countdown" class="font-bold"></span>)
- Full implementation required: **December 11, 2027** (<span id="implementation-countdown" class="font-bold"></span>)

<script>
    function formatCountdown(targetDate) {
        const now = new Date();
        const target = new Date(targetDate);

        let months = (target.getFullYear() - now.getFullYear()) * 12;
        months += target.getMonth() - now.getMonth();

        // Calculate days left if in the same month
        const daysLeft = Math.ceil((target - now) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));

        // Adjust for day of month
        if (target.getDate() < now.getDate()) {
            months--;
        }

        const years = Math.floor(months / 12);
        const remainingMonths = months % 12;

        if (months < 0) {
            return 'Deadline passed';
        } else if (years === 0 && remainingMonths === 0) {
            return `${daysLeft} days away`;
        } else if (years === 0) {
            return `${remainingMonths} months away`;
        } else if (remainingMonths === 0) {
            return `${years} years away`;
        } else {
            return `${years} years, ${remainingMonths} months away`;
        }
    }

    function updateCountdowns() {
        const dates = {
            'force': 'December 10, 2024',
            'reporting': 'September 11, 2026',
            'implementation': 'December 11, 2027'
        };

        for (const [key, date] of Object.entries(dates)) {
            const element = document.getElementById(`${key}-countdown`);
            if (element) {
                element.innerHTML = formatCountdown(date);
            }
        }
    }

    // Update immediately and then every day
    updateCountdowns();
    setInterval(updateCountdowns, 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);
</script>

These dates represent critical milestones for organizations operating in or selling to the EU market. Similarly, in the United States, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework has established SBOMs as a crucial element of comprehensive cybersecurity practices.

As regulatory requirements continue to evolve, SBOMs are becoming the de facto standard for software supply chain transparency. Organizations that haven't yet implemented SBOM practices risk falling behind in both compliance and overall cybersecurity posture. The benefits of adoption are clear:

- Enhanced visibility into software components
- Improved vulnerability identification and remediation
- Stronger trust relationships with customers and partners

Time is critical in this evolving landscape. Organizations that delay SBOM adoption risk falling out of compliance with regulatory requirements and industry best practices. More importantly, they expose themselves to increased risk in an era of increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. For organizations that haven't yet integrated SBOMs into their software development and procurement processes, the urgency is clear: SBOM adoption isn't just about complianceâ€”it's fundamental to ensuring the security and resilience of modern software infrastructure.
