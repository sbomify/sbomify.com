## Our Mission

At sbomify, we believe that software transparency is the foundation of trust in the digital age. As software supply chains become increasingly complex, the need for clear, manageable, and actionable security compliance data has never been greater.

We exist to bridge the gap between software vendors and buyers, providing the tools and infrastructure needed to make transparency a seamless part of the development and procurement lifecycle.

Whether you are a software vendor ensuring compliance with regulations like the EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) or a buyer verifying the security of your software assets, sbomify provides the platform to manage, share, and analyze SBOMs with confidence.

## The Origin Story

sbomify was born out of necessity. It was created by Viktor Petersson, driven by his firsthand experience as co-founder of [Screenly](https://www.screenly.io), a leading secure digital signage platform, while implementing a "Secure by Design" and "Secure by Default" philosophy.

During this journey, Viktor discovered significant shortcomings in existing solutions for SBOM lifecycle management — challenges that were later echoed in CISA's [SBOM Sharing Primer](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-05/SBOM%20Sharing%20Primer.pdf). While tools existed for generation, the ecosystem for managing, sharing, and enriching these artifacts was fragmented and insufficient for modern security needs. Another key insight was the need to accurately describe real-world products through a **product, project, and component** hierarchy, as outlined in our [lifecycle guide]({{ site.url }}/features/generate-collaborate-analyze/). sbomify was built to fill these gaps, offering a streamlined platform that addresses the real-world challenges of software supply chain transparency.

Our technology is deeply rooted in industry best practices. Our SBOM generation tool is based on the blueprint from the CISA working group on SBOM generation, which Viktor co-led. This ensures that our approach aligns with the highest standards of security and compliance from the ground up.
