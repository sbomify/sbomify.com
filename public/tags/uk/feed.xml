This initiative aims to enhance the security and resilience of software sold to businesses and organizations. The Code, co-designed with industry and academic experts, outlines fundamental principles for secure design, development, deployment, and customer communication. It seeks feedback on its suitability and the supporting materials provided. This effort is part of broader measures to strengthen cybersecurity across the UK’s digital supply chains and improve organizational resilience.&lt;/p>
