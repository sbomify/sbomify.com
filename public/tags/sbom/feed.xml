&lt;p>The first thing you will notice is that &lt;strong>sbomify feels faster&lt;/strong>. Pages load more quickly, transitions are smoother, and the interface is more consistent throughout the application. Dark mode now works reliably across every page, and accessibility has been improved with better contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Under the hood, we rebuilt the entire frontend from scratch. But what matters to you is the result: a cleaner, more polished experience that gets out of your way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have also redesigned the &lt;strong>onboarding wizard&lt;/strong>. New users can now get from sign-up to their first SBOM upload in fewer steps, with clearer guidance at each stage.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="real-time-dashboard-updates">Real-Time Dashboard Updates&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Until now, checking whether an assessment finished or a new SBOM was uploaded meant manually refreshing the page. That changes with v0.26.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your dashboard now updates in &lt;strong>real-time&lt;/strong>. When a teammate uploads an SBOM, a compliance assessment completes, or a component status changes, you see it immediately. No more guessing, no more stale data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From your perspective, it just works.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="bsi-tr-03183-2-compliance">BSI TR-03183-2 Compliance&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you operate in Germany or sell into the German market, sbomify now supports automated compliance checking against &lt;strong>BSI TR-03183-2&lt;/strong> — the German Federal Office for Information Security&amp;rsquo;s technical guideline for SBOM quality and completeness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like our other compliance plugins, you can enable it in &lt;strong>Settings -&amp;gt; Plugins&lt;/strong>. Once enabled, every SBOM upload is assessed automatically against the BSI requirements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This plugin also introduces a &lt;strong>dependency system&lt;/strong> for compliance plugins. Plugins can now build on each other, so related standards share foundational checks rather than duplicating work. This means more consistent results across overlapping compliance frameworks.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="gdpr-self-service-account-deletion">GDPR Self-Service Account Deletion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Under GDPR, you have the right to delete your account and all associated data. Previously, this required contacting our support team and waiting for manual processing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With v0.26, you can &lt;strong>delete your own account&lt;/strong> directly from your profile settings. No tickets, no waiting. Your data is removed in accordance with our data retention policy.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="fine-grained-access-control">Fine-Grained Access Control&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can now control who sees what at a more granular level. Set &lt;strong>component visibility&lt;/strong> to restrict which components are visible to which roles, and control &lt;strong>document-level access&lt;/strong> to limit who can view specific SBOM documents.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is particularly useful for organizations sharing SBOMs externally through the &lt;strong>Trust Center&lt;/strong>. You can make some components public for customers and partners while keeping internal components private — all from the same workspace.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="other-improvements">Other Improvements&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Version field on Releases&lt;/strong> — You can now track release versions aligned with the Transparency Exchange API (TEA), making it easier to correlate SBOMs with specific product versions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improved error tracking&lt;/strong> — We catch and resolve issues faster now, often before you notice them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Custom login experience&lt;/strong> — The login page now uses a branded sbomify theme with better password validation feedback, so you know exactly what is needed when setting or changing your password.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Zero-downtime deployments&lt;/strong> — Deployments no longer cause brief interruptions. Updates happen seamlessly in the background, so the platform is always available.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Fixed an issue where compliance assessments could fail on retry.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fixed IP address capture in NDA audit trails.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Improved error responses for duplicate SBOM uploads — the API response now includes an error code for easier debugging in CI/CD pipelines.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For self-hosted users, note that sbomify v0.26 now requires &lt;strong>Python 3.13&lt;/strong>. We have also updated several key dependencies, including gunicorn 25.x, ruff 0.15.x, and bandit 1.9.3. Check the full changelog for upgrade notes before updating your deployment.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you are on the &lt;strong>hosted platform&lt;/strong>, everything is already live — no action needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For &lt;strong>self-hosted&lt;/strong> deployments, update to v0.26.0 by pulling the latest release.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Check out the &lt;a href="https://github.com/sbomify/sbomify/compare/v0.25.1...v0.26.0">full changelog on GitHub&lt;/a> for complete details.

In cybersecurity, SBOMs answer the question that every security team must be able to answer: &lt;em>what is in our software?&lt;/em> Without this visibility, vulnerability management, incident response, and compliance are all reactive at best and impossible at worst.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-sboms-matter-for-cybersecurity">Why SBOMs Matter for Cybersecurity&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Modern software is assembled from open source and third-party components. A typical application consists of &lt;a href="https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/estimating-total-number-linux-contributors-approach-using-linus-law/">70-90% open source code&lt;/a> drawn from package registries. Each component is a potential entry point for attackers — whether through known vulnerabilities, compromised packages, or abandoned libraries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SBOMs make the composition of software visible. This visibility is the prerequisite for every other cybersecurity activity involving third-party code: you cannot patch what you do not know you are running.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="sboms-and-vulnerability-management">SBOMs and Vulnerability Management&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Vulnerability management is the cybersecurity function that benefits most directly from SBOMs. The workflow connects component inventories to threat intelligence, creating a continuous monitoring capability.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-problem-without-sboms">The Problem Without SBOMs&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When a new &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/18/cve-vulnerability-explained/">CVE&lt;/a> is disclosed, organizations without SBOMs must:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Manually determine which components are used across all applications&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Check each application&amp;rsquo;s dependency files (if accessible)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Search container images, build artifacts, and deployment manifests&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Aggregate findings across teams and environments&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This manual process can take days or weeks. During that time, the vulnerability may be actively exploited.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-solution-with-sboms">The Solution With SBOMs&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>With SBOMs generated and ingested into a management platform like &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://dependencytrack.org/">OWASP Dependency-Track&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>New CVE is published to vulnerability databases&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Platform automatically matches the CVE to SBOM component inventories&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Affected products and versions are identified within seconds&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Alerts are sent to the responsible teams&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Remediation begins immediately&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This automated approach reduces the response window from days to minutes. The difference is especially critical for vulnerabilities listed in the &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/30/what-is-kev-cisa-known-exploited-vulnerabilities/">CISA KEV catalog&lt;/a> — those confirmed to be actively exploited in the wild.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="incident-response-the-log4shell-case-study">Incident Response: The Log4Shell Case Study&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Log4Shell vulnerability (&lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228">CVE-2021-44228&lt;/a>) in December 2021 is the defining example of why SBOMs matter for cybersecurity. Apache Log4j was a ubiquitous Java logging library used as both a direct and transitive &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/29/what-is-a-dependency-in-software/">dependency&lt;/a> in millions of applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Organizations with SBOMs&lt;/strong> queried their component inventories and identified affected systems within minutes. They knew exactly which applications used Log4j, at which versions, and in which environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Organizations without SBOMs&lt;/strong> spent weeks manually auditing codebases, scanning containers, and contacting vendors to determine exposure. Some discovered Log4j in applications they did not even know existed in their environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Log4Shell became the single most cited argument for SBOM adoption. It demonstrated that in a crisis, the ability to answer &amp;ldquo;which of our systems are affected?&amp;rdquo; is not optional — it is a core cybersecurity capability.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="sboms-and-the-compliance-landscape">SBOMs and the Compliance Landscape&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Multiple cybersecurity regulations and frameworks now require or strongly recommend SBOMs. This reflects the growing consensus that software transparency is essential for security.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="united-states">United States&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/eo-14028/">Executive Order 14028&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> (&amp;ldquo;Improving the Nation&amp;rsquo;s Cybersecurity&amp;rdquo;, 2021) directed federal agencies to require SBOMs from software vendors. It established SBOMs as a baseline expectation for government software procurement.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/cisa-minimum-elements/">CISA Minimum Elements&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> defines the recommended fields for SBOMs, building on the &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/ntia-minimum-elements/">NTIA minimum elements&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/nist-800-53/">NIST SP 800-53&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> includes supply chain risk management controls (SR family) that SBOMs help satisfy, particularly SR-4 (Provenance) and CM-8 (Component Inventory).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/nist-800-171/">NIST SP 800-171&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> (Rev 3) added a Supply Chain Risk Management family (03.17) relevant to DoD contractors handling Controlled Unclassified Information.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/fda-medical-device/">FDA Medical Device Guidance&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> requires SBOMs for medical device premarket submissions.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>SBOMs support cybersecurity at every stage:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="prevention">Prevention&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Dependency auditing.&lt;/strong> SBOMs reveal the full dependency tree including &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/29/what-is-a-dependency-in-software/">transitive dependencies&lt;/a>, enabling teams to identify and replace risky components before deployment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>License compliance.&lt;/strong> SBOMs document the license of every component, preventing license conflicts that can create legal exposure. See our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/22/gpl-license-guide/">GPL&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/22/mit-license-guide/">MIT&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/07/apache-license-2-guide/">Apache 2.0&lt;/a> guides for license-specific details.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Policy enforcement.&lt;/strong> SBOM-based tools can block deployments that include components with known critical vulnerabilities or prohibited licenses.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="detection">Detection&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Continuous vulnerability monitoring.&lt;/strong> SBOMs ingested into platforms like OWASP Dependency-Track are continuously matched against the &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/">NVD&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://osv.dev/">OSV&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">CISA KEV catalog&lt;/a>. See our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/02/01/sbom-scanning-vulnerability-detection/">SBOM scanning guide&lt;/a> for implementation details.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/02/05/what-is-cvss-vulnerability-scoring/">CVSS&lt;/a>-based triage.&lt;/strong> SBOMs paired with vulnerability data enable automated severity assessment, prioritizing critical and high-severity issues.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="response">Response&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Rapid impact assessment.&lt;/strong> Query SBOM repositories to immediately identify which products and environments contain an affected component.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Targeted remediation.&lt;/strong> Knowing exactly where a vulnerable component is deployed enables precise patching rather than broad emergency measures.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>VEX communication.&lt;/strong> Use Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) documents to communicate whether a reported vulnerability actually affects your product.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="recovery">Recovery&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Audit trail.&lt;/strong> Retained SBOMs provide a historical record of what was deployed at any point in time, supporting post-incident analysis and regulatory reporting.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Rebuild verification.&lt;/strong> SBOMs document the components that should be present, enabling verification that rebuilt or patched software matches the intended composition.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you are beginning your SBOM journey:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Start generating SBOMs.&lt;/strong> Use our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/guides/">language-specific SBOM guides&lt;/a> to generate SBOMs for your projects in &lt;a href="https://cyclonedx.org/">CycloneDX&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://spdx.dev/">SPDX&lt;/a> format. See our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/15/sbom-formats-cyclonedx-vs-spdx/">SBOM formats comparison&lt;/a> for format guidance.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Automate generation in CI/CD.&lt;/strong> Integrate SBOM generation into your build pipeline using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/sbomify/github-action/">sbomify GitHub Action&lt;/a>, which handles generation, enrichment, and augmentation in one step. Standalone tools like &lt;a href="https://github.com/anchore/syft">Syft&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy">Trivy&lt;/a> are also available. See our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/26/sbom-generation-tools-comparison/">SBOM generation tools comparison&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Set up vulnerability monitoring.&lt;/strong> Use &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a> for integrated monitoring (built-in OSV and Dependency-Track scanning), or deploy a standalone &lt;a href="https://dependencytrack.org/">OWASP Dependency-Track&lt;/a> instance for continuous monitoring.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Establish a management process.&lt;/strong> Define how SBOMs are stored, versioned, and distributed. See our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/18/sbom-management-best-practices/">SBOM management guide&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Map to compliance requirements.&lt;/strong> Identify which compliance frameworks apply to your organization and ensure your SBOM process meets their requirements. See our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/">compliance overview&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="how-do-sboms-improve-cybersecurity">How do SBOMs improve cybersecurity?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>SBOMs improve cybersecurity by providing component-level visibility into software. This visibility enables automated vulnerability detection (matching components against CVE databases), rapid incident response (immediately identifying affected systems when a new vulnerability is disclosed), continuous compliance monitoring (tracking regulatory requirements), and informed risk management (understanding the full dependency chain and its associated risks).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="are-sboms-required-for-cybersecurity-compliance">Are SBOMs required for cybersecurity compliance?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>SBOMs are required or strongly recommended by multiple frameworks: U.S. Executive Order 14028 requires them for federal software procurement, the EU Cyber Resilience Act requires them for products with digital elements, FDA guidance requires them for medical device submissions, and NIST SP 800-53/800-171 include supply chain controls that SBOMs help satisfy. See our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/">compliance overview&lt;/a> for a framework-by-framework breakdown.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-did-log4shell-demonstrate-the-need-for-sboms">How did Log4Shell demonstrate the need for SBOMs?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When the Log4Shell vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) was disclosed in December 2021, organizations with SBOMs identified affected systems in minutes by querying their component inventories. Organizations without SBOMs spent weeks manually auditing codebases and scanning infrastructure. This stark contrast made Log4Shell the most commonly cited example of why SBOMs are essential for cybersecurity incident response.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-the-relationship-between-sboms-and-vulnerability-management">What is the relationship between SBOMs and vulnerability management?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>SBOMs provide the component inventory that vulnerability management depends on. Without knowing what components are in your software, you cannot determine which vulnerabilities affect you. SBOMs ingested into monitoring platforms are continuously matched against vulnerability databases, enabling automated detection and alerting. This transforms vulnerability management from a periodic manual exercise into a continuous automated process.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-do-i-start-using-sboms-for-cybersecurity">How do I start using SBOMs for cybersecurity?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Start by generating SBOMs for your applications using tools like Syft, Trivy, or language-specific generators. Automate generation in your CI/CD pipeline. Ingest SBOMs into a monitoring platform like OWASP Dependency-Track for continuous vulnerability scanning. Define remediation SLAs based on CVSS severity and KEV status. See our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/guides/">SBOM guides&lt;/a> for step-by-step instructions.&lt;/p></description><category>education</category></item><item><title>Announcing sbomify-action v0.13: The One Where We Go to FOSDEM</title><link>https://sbomify.com/2026/02/04/announcing-sbomify-action-v0-13-the-one-where-we-go-to-fosdem/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sbomify.com/2026/02/04/announcing-sbomify-action-v0-13-the-one-where-we-go-to-fosdem/</guid><description>&lt;p>We timed the sbomify-action v0.13 release for &lt;a href="https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/UYTGWA-sbom-generation/">FOSDEM 2026&lt;/a>, where we presented on CRA-ready SBOM generation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="fosdem-2026-cra-ready-sboms">FOSDEM 2026: CRA-Ready SBOMs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This past weekend, we presented at FOSDEM in the Software Bill of Materials devroom. The talk covers a four-phase SBOM generation model addressing the EU&amp;rsquo;s Cyber Resilience Act requirements: authoring, augmenting, enriching, and signing SBOMs to exceed minimal compliance standards. It includes a demo of an open-source workflow using sbomify-action, helping teams avoid compliance gaps as the CRA timeline approaches.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="whats-new-in-v013">What&amp;rsquo;s New in v0.13&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="breaking-changes">Breaking Changes&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Python 3.11+ now required&lt;/strong> - We have increased the minimum Python version from 3.10 to 3.11 to take advantage of the built-in &lt;code>tomllib&lt;/code> module for TOML parsing. If you are running sbomify-action locally, ensure you have Python 3.11 or later installed.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="new-features">New Features&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="hash-enrichment-from-lockfiles">Hash Enrichment from Lockfiles&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A common gap in SBOMs is missing cryptographic hashes for components. Many SBOM generation tools do not extract hashes, even when they are available in lockfiles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The new hash enrichment subsystem automatically extracts cryptographic hashes from your lockfiles and adds them to SBOM components. This improves SBOM quality and supports integrity verification workflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Supported lockfiles:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Cargo.lock (Rust)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>package-lock.json (npm)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pipfile.lock (Pipenv)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>pnpm-lock.yaml (pnpm)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>poetry.lock (Poetry)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>pubspec.lock (Dart/Flutter)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>uv.lock (uv)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>yarn.lock (Yarn)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="interactive-configuration-wizard">Interactive Configuration Wizard&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Getting started with sbomify-action is now easier than ever. The new &lt;code>sbomify init&lt;/code> command walks you through an interactive wizard to create your &lt;code>sbomify.json&lt;/code> configuration file. Answer a few questions about your project, and the wizard generates a working configuration.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sbomify-action init
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h3 id="conan-center-enrichment">Conan Center Enrichment&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>C/C++ projects using Conan now get automatic metadata enrichment from the Conan Center API. For each package, we fetch:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>License information&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Author details&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Homepage URL&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Repository URL&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Package description&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This follows our enrichment-first philosophy: even if your SBOM generation tool produces sparse output, sbomify-action fills in the gaps from authoritative sources.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="component-supplier-field-ntia-compliance">Component Supplier Field (NTIA Compliance)&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>NTIA&amp;rsquo;s minimum elements for SBOMs include supplier information. Previously, some tools would populate this with package authors, which is not quite right. The supplier should be the distribution platform, not the individual who wrote the code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Components now include a &lt;code>supplier&lt;/code> field populated with the distribution platform:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>PyPI for Python packages&lt;/li>
&lt;li>npm for JavaScript packages&lt;/li>
&lt;li>crates.io for Rust packages&lt;/li>
&lt;li>And so on for other ecosystems&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This improves compliance with NTIA SBOM requirements.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="purl-generation-from-vcs-url">PURL Generation from VCS URL&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>For SPDX SBOMs, the main package component now generates a PURL from the VCS (Version Control System) URL when no explicit PURL is available. This ensures better NTIA compliance by providing a unique identifier for your software, even when traditional package manager PURLs are not applicable.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="organization-data-from-contact-profile-api">Organization Data from Contact Profile API&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The sbomify API integration now extracts organizational data from the contact_profile structure. This means your SBOMs can include accurate manufacturer and supplier organization details from your sbomify account settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="improvements">Improvements&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="lifecycle-property-standardization">Lifecycle Property Standardization&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We have updated lifecycle properties to use the official CycloneDX taxonomy. If you are using lifecycle data in your SBOMs, the property names have changed:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Old Property&lt;/th>
&lt;th>New Property&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;code>cle:releaseDate&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;code>cdx:lifecycle:milestone:generalAvailability&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;code>cle:eos&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;code>cdx:lifecycle:milestone:endOfSupport&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;code>cle:eol&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;code>cdx:lifecycle:milestone:endOfLife&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>This aligns with the CycloneDX specification and improves interoperability with other tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="better-error-handling">Better Error Handling&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We have made significant improvements to error handling throughout the tool:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>ToolNotAvailableError&lt;/strong> - Graceful handling when SBOM generation tools are missing, with clear instructions on what to install&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improved &amp;ldquo;component not found&amp;rdquo; messages&lt;/strong> - More context about what failed and why&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Better diagnostic info&lt;/strong> - SBOM generation errors now include more details for debugging&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Path expansion errors&lt;/strong> - Now include the file name and searched paths&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>CLI flag detection&lt;/strong> - Helpful error when a file path looks like a CLI flag (a common typo)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Stdout capture&lt;/strong> - Tools that output errors to stdout instead of stderr are now handled correctly&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

Rather than re-analyzing source code or container images for each new vulnerability disclosure, SBOM scanning matches the component inventory already documented in your SBOM against vulnerability databases. This makes it possible to continuously monitor your entire software portfolio for newly disclosed threats without rescanning every artifact.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-sbom-scanning-works">How SBOM Scanning Works&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The SBOM scanning workflow has three stages:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="1-component-identification">1. Component Identification&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The scanner reads the SBOM and extracts component identifiers — primarily &lt;a href="https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec">Package URLs (purls)&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe">CPEs&lt;/a> — along with version information. These identifiers are the keys used to look up vulnerability data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A purl like &lt;code>pkg:npm/lodash@4.17.20&lt;/code> tells the scanner exactly which package (lodash), from which registry (npm), at which version (4.17.20) to check. The more precise your SBOM&amp;rsquo;s identifiers, the more accurate the scan results.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="2-database-matching">2. Database Matching&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The scanner queries one or more vulnerability databases to find known &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/18/cve-vulnerability-explained/">CVEs&lt;/a> affecting the identified components. Major databases include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/">National Vulnerability Database (NVD)&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> — The U.S. government&amp;rsquo;s comprehensive CVE database with &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/02/05/what-is-cvss-vulnerability-scoring/">CVSS&lt;/a> severity scores&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://osv.dev/">OSV (Open Source Vulnerabilities)&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> — Google&amp;rsquo;s database focused on open source package vulnerabilities, with ecosystem-specific advisory data&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://github.com/advisories">GitHub Advisory Database&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> — Community-curated advisories with package-manager-specific versioning&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">CISA KEV Catalog&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> — The list of vulnerabilities with confirmed &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/30/what-is-kev-cisa-known-exploited-vulnerabilities/">active exploitation&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="3-result-reporting">3. Result Reporting&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The scanner produces a report listing each vulnerability found, typically including:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The affected component and version&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The CVE identifier&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The CVSS severity score&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whether the vulnerability is listed in the CISA KEV catalog&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fix availability (which version resolves the vulnerability)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Advisory details and references&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="sbom-scanning-tools">SBOM Scanning Tools&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="grype">Grype&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/anchore/grype">Grype&lt;/a> is an open source vulnerability scanner from Anchore that accepts SBOMs as direct input. It is designed to work with SBOMs generated by &lt;a href="https://github.com/anchore/syft">Syft&lt;/a> but supports any CycloneDX or SPDX SBOM.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e"># Scan an SBOM file&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>grype sbom:./my-sbom.cdx.json
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e"># Scan an SBOM with specific output format&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>grype sbom:./my-sbom.spdx.json -o table
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Grype matches against multiple vulnerability databases including the NVD, OSV, and ecosystem-specific advisories. It runs as a CLI tool, making it straightforward to integrate into CI/CD pipelines.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="owasp-dependency-track">OWASP Dependency-Track&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://dependencytrack.org/">OWASP Dependency-Track&lt;/a> is a continuous SBOM analysis platform. Unlike CLI scanners that run once, Dependency-Track ingests SBOMs into a persistent database and continuously re-evaluates them as new vulnerabilities are published.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Key capabilities:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Ingests SBOMs in CycloneDX and SPDX formats via API or web upload&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Monitors against NVD, OSV, GitHub Advisories, and other sources&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Provides a dashboard showing risk across your entire portfolio&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sends notifications when new vulnerabilities affect your components&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Supports policy management for automated risk evaluation&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Dependency-Track is particularly valuable for &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/18/sbom-management-best-practices/">SBOM management&lt;/a> at scale — it maintains a centralized view of all your software components and their vulnerability status.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="osv-scanner">OSV-Scanner&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/">OSV-Scanner&lt;/a> from Google uses the &lt;a href="https://osv.dev/">OSV database&lt;/a> and supports SBOM input. It focuses on open source package vulnerabilities with ecosystem-specific version matching.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e"># Scan an SBOM&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>osv-scanner scan source -S my-sbom.cdx.json
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h3 id="trivy">Trivy&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy">Trivy&lt;/a> can scan SBOMs for vulnerabilities in addition to its source directory and container image scanning capabilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e"># Scan an SBOM&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>trivy sbom my-sbom.cdx.json
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h3 id="sbomify">sbomify&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a> integrates vulnerability monitoring directly into its SBOM management platform. When you upload SBOMs to sbomify, they are automatically scanned against &lt;a href="https://osv.dev/">Google OSV&lt;/a> for known vulnerabilities. For organizations needing deeper analysis, sbomify also integrates with &lt;a href="https://dependencytrack.org/">OWASP Dependency-Track&lt;/a>. This means generation, storage, scanning, and distribution happen in a single workflow rather than requiring separate tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a broader tool comparison, see our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/26/sbom-generation-tools-comparison/">SBOM generation tools guide&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/resources/">resources page&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="setting-up-continuous-monitoring">Setting Up Continuous Monitoring&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Point-in-time scanning catches vulnerabilities known at scan time but misses those disclosed afterward. Continuous monitoring solves this by repeatedly matching your SBOMs against updated vulnerability databases.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-workflow">The Workflow&lt;/h3>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Generate SBOMs&lt;/strong> in your CI/CD pipeline with every build using tools from our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/guides/">SBOM generation guides&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ingest SBOMs&lt;/strong> into a monitoring platform (&lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a>, OWASP Dependency-Track, or equivalent)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Configure data sources&lt;/strong> — connect the platform to NVD, OSV, KEV, and ecosystem-specific advisory feeds&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Set up notifications&lt;/strong> — alert the appropriate team when new vulnerabilities are found in their components&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Define policies&lt;/strong> — establish severity thresholds and SLAs for remediation&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="why-continuous-monitoring-matters">Why Continuous Monitoring Matters&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>New CVEs are published daily. A component that was clean when you deployed it may have a critical vulnerability disclosed a week later. Without continuous monitoring, you will not know until the next scheduled scan — which may be too late.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">CISA KEV catalog&lt;/a> is updated multiple times per week with vulnerabilities that are actively being exploited. Continuous monitoring against KEV ensures you are alerted immediately when a component in your portfolio is under active attack.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="acting-on-scan-results">Acting on Scan Results&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Scanning without action is overhead. An effective vulnerability response process turns scan results into remediation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="prioritization">Prioritization&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Not all vulnerabilities require immediate action. Prioritize based on:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>KEV status.&lt;/strong> If the vulnerability is in the &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/30/what-is-kev-cisa-known-exploited-vulnerabilities/">CISA KEV catalog&lt;/a>, it is being actively exploited — treat it as urgent regardless of CVSS score.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>CVSS severity.&lt;/strong> Critical (9.0-10.0) and High (7.0-8.9) vulnerabilities warrant faster response. See our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/02/05/what-is-cvss-vulnerability-scoring/">CVSS guide&lt;/a> for scoring details.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Exploitability.&lt;/strong> Is there a public exploit? Is the vulnerability exploitable remotely without authentication?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Deployment context.&lt;/strong> Is the affected component in an internet-facing application or an internal tool? Is the vulnerable code path actually reachable?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Fix availability.&lt;/strong> If a patched version exists, updating is straightforward. If no fix is available, you need a workaround or compensating control.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="remediation">Remediation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The most common remediation is updating the vulnerable component to a fixed version. For transitive dependencies, this may require updating the direct dependency that pulls it in — see our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/29/what-is-a-dependency-in-software/">dependency guide&lt;/a> for details on dependency trees.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When an update is not immediately possible:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Apply vendor-recommended mitigations or workarounds&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Implement compensating controls (WAF rules, network restrictions)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Document the accepted risk with a timeline for permanent remediation&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="vex-vulnerability-exploitability-exchange">VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange)&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>VEX is a standardized way to communicate whether a vulnerability in a component actually affects a specific product. A VEX statement might declare that CVE-2024-XXXX in lodash &amp;ldquo;does not affect&amp;rdquo; your application because the vulnerable function is never called.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VEX reduces false positives by distinguishing between &amp;ldquo;this component has a known CVE&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;this CVE actually impacts our product.&amp;rdquo; Both &lt;a href="https://cyclonedx.org/">CycloneDX&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/openvex">OpenVEX&lt;/a> support VEX documents that can be consumed by scanning tools to suppress known non-exploitable findings.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="best-practices">Best Practices&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Scan SBOMs, not just source code.&lt;/strong> SBOM scanning catches vulnerabilities in deployed components, including OS-level packages in &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/03/container-security-best-practices/">containers&lt;/a> that do not appear in your source repository.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Monitor continuously.&lt;/strong> Do not rely on scan-at-build-time alone. Use a platform like &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a> or OWASP Dependency-Track for ongoing monitoring against updated vulnerability feeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Prioritize with KEV.&lt;/strong> Use the CISA KEV catalog as a top-priority signal. KEV-listed vulnerabilities are confirmed to be actively exploited and should be remediated first.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Define SLAs.&lt;/strong> Establish clear timelines for remediation based on severity and exploitability. Example: KEV-listed critical vulnerabilities within 48 hours; critical non-KEV within 2 weeks; high severity within 30 days.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Use VEX to reduce noise.&lt;/strong> When a vulnerability does not affect your product (because the vulnerable code path is not reachable), document this with a VEX statement rather than suppressing the alert entirely.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Automate the pipeline.&lt;/strong> Generate SBOMs automatically in CI/CD, ingest them into monitoring automatically, and route alerts to the right teams automatically. Manual steps create gaps.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-sbom-scanning">What is SBOM scanning?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>SBOM scanning is the process of analyzing a Software Bill of Materials to identify known vulnerabilities, license issues, and other risks in the components it documents. Scanners match SBOM component identifiers (purls, CPEs) against vulnerability databases like the NVD and OSV to find known CVEs. This enables continuous vulnerability monitoring without repeatedly scanning source code or container images.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-tools-scan-sboms-for-vulnerabilities">What tools scan SBOMs for vulnerabilities?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Leading SBOM scanning tools include &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a> (integrated platform with built-in OSV and Dependency-Track scanning), Grype (CLI scanner from Anchore), OWASP Dependency-Track (standalone monitoring platform), OSV-Scanner (Google&amp;rsquo;s open source scanner), and Trivy (comprehensive security scanner from Aqua Security). Grype and Trivy are best for CI/CD pipeline integration; sbomify and Dependency-Track are best for ongoing portfolio monitoring.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-often-should-i-scan-my-sboms">How often should I scan my SBOMs?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>SBOMs should be scanned continuously, not just at build time. New vulnerabilities are disclosed daily, and a component that was clean at build time may have a critical CVE disclosed afterward. Use a continuous monitoring platform that automatically re-evaluates your SBOMs as vulnerability databases are updated.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-sbom-scanning-and-sca">What is the difference between SBOM scanning and SCA?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/11/software-composition-analysis-sca/">Software Composition Analysis (SCA)&lt;/a> scans source code, dependency files, or binaries to identify components and their vulnerabilities. SBOM scanning takes an already-generated SBOM as input and matches its components against vulnerability databases. SCA produces the inventory; SBOM scanning monitors it over time. They are complementary — SCA for discovery, SBOM scanning for continuous monitoring.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-vex">What is VEX?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange) is a standardized format for communicating whether a known vulnerability in a component actually affects a specific product. A VEX statement can declare that a CVE &amp;ldquo;does not affect,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;is under investigation,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;is affected&amp;rdquo; in your product. VEX reduces false positives from SBOM scanning by distinguishing theoretical vulnerability from actual impact.&lt;/p></description><category>education</category></item><item><title>What Is a Dependency in Software? A Beginner&amp;#39;s Guide</title><link>https://sbomify.com/2026/01/29/what-is-a-dependency-in-software/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sbomify.com/2026/01/29/what-is-a-dependency-in-software/</guid><description>&lt;p>A dependency in software is any external component — a library, framework, module, or package — that your application relies on to function. When you import a package from npm, add a library from PyPI, or include a Maven artifact, you are adding a dependency. Dependencies allow developers to reuse tested, maintained code rather than writing everything from scratch. Modern applications are built overwhelmingly from dependencies: studies consistently show that &lt;a href="https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/estimating-total-number-linux-contributors-approach-using-linus-law/">70-90% of a typical application consists of open source components&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="direct-vs-transitive-dependencies">Direct vs. Transitive Dependencies&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The most important distinction in dependency management is between direct and transitive dependencies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Direct dependencies&lt;/strong> are the packages your project explicitly declares. These appear in your dependency manifest — &lt;code>package.json&lt;/code> for JavaScript, &lt;code>requirements.txt&lt;/code> or &lt;code>pyproject.toml&lt;/code> for Python, &lt;code>pom.xml&lt;/code> for Java, &lt;code>go.mod&lt;/code> for Go, &lt;code>Cargo.toml&lt;/code> for Rust, and similar files for other ecosystems. You chose these packages, you decided which versions to use, and you are (presumably) aware of their purpose in your application.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Transitive dependencies&lt;/strong> are the dependencies of your dependencies. When you add package A to your project, and package A depends on packages B and C, and package B depends on package D, then B, C, and D are all transitive dependencies of your project. You may never have heard of packages B, C, or D, yet they are running in your application and their vulnerabilities are your vulnerabilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-scale-of-transitive-dependencies">The Scale of Transitive Dependencies&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The ratio of transitive to direct dependencies is often surprising:&lt;/p>

&lt;/table>
&lt;p>A JavaScript project with 30 direct dependencies may pull in over 1,000 transitive packages through the npm dependency tree. Each of those packages is code running in your application, with its own maintenance status, license, and vulnerability history.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-dependency-tree">The Dependency Tree&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A dependency tree (or dependency graph) is the complete set of relationships between a project and all of its dependencies, both direct and transitive. Visualizing this tree reveals the full scope of what your application depends on.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>my-application
├── express@4.18.2 (direct)
│ ├── body-parser@1.20.2 (transitive)
│ │ ├── bytes@3.1.2
│ │ └── iconv-lite@0.4.24
│ │ └── safer-buffer@2.1.2
│ ├── cookie@0.5.0
│ └── ...
├── lodash@4.17.21 (direct)
└── axios@1.6.2 (direct)
└── follow-redirects@1.15.3 (transitive)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>In this example, &lt;code>express&lt;/code>, &lt;code>lodash&lt;/code>, and &lt;code>axios&lt;/code> are direct dependencies. Everything nested beneath them is transitive. The vulnerability in &lt;code>safer-buffer&lt;/code> — four levels deep — is just as dangerous as one in &lt;code>express&lt;/code> itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-dependencies-matter-for-security">Why Dependencies Matter for Security&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Dependencies are the primary attack surface for most applications. Several high-profile incidents illustrate the risks:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="vulnerable-dependencies">Vulnerable Dependencies&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228">Log4Shell vulnerability&lt;/a> (&lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/18/cve-vulnerability-explained/">CVE-2021-44228&lt;/a>) in the Apache Log4j logging library affected millions of Java applications. Many organizations did not know they used Log4j because it was a transitive dependency — pulled in by frameworks and libraries they did depend on directly.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="compromised-dependencies">Compromised Dependencies&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3094">XZ Utils backdoor&lt;/a> demonstrated that attackers can spend years gaining trust in a legitimate open source project before inserting malicious code. When a dependency is compromised, every application that uses it is affected.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="abandoned-dependencies">Abandoned Dependencies&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Dependencies that are no longer maintained represent a growing risk. When a &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/18/cve-vulnerability-explained/">CVE&lt;/a> is found in an unmaintained package, there may be no one to produce a patch. The component stays vulnerable indefinitely unless consumers fork it or find an alternative.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="dependency-confusion">Dependency Confusion&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Dependency confusion attacks exploit the way package managers resolve names. An attacker publishes a malicious package to a public registry with the same name as a private internal package. If the package manager checks the public registry first (or alongside) the private one, it may install the attacker&amp;rsquo;s package instead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a deeper discussion of supply chain attacks, see our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/26/software-supply-chain-management/">software supply chain management guide&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lock-files">Lock Files&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Lock files are a critical tool for dependency management. They record the exact versions of every dependency (direct and transitive) that were resolved during installation, ensuring that subsequent installations produce identical results.&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Ecosystem&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Lock File&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Manifest File&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>JavaScript&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;code>package-lock.json&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;code>package.json&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Python&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;code>poetry.lock&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;code>pyproject.toml&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Rust&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;code>Cargo.lock&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;code>Cargo.toml&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Go&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;code>go.sum&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;code>go.mod&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Ruby&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;code>Gemfile.lock&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;code>Gemfile&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>PHP&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;code>composer.lock&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;code>composer.json&lt;/code>&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Without a lock file, the same manifest can resolve to different dependency versions on different machines or at different times. This non-determinism is both a reliability risk (builds may break unpredictably) and a security risk (a newly published malicious version could be pulled in automatically).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lock files should always be committed to version control. They are the source of truth for what is actually installed in your project.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-sboms-document-dependencies">How SBOMs Document Dependencies&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/what-is-sbom/">Software Bill of Materials&lt;/a> provides a complete, machine-readable inventory of every component in your software, including all transitive dependencies. This is essential for security because:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Full visibility.&lt;/strong> An SBOM documents every package in the dependency tree, not just the direct dependencies listed in your manifest file. This is the only reliable way to know everything running in your application.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Vulnerability matching.&lt;/strong> Once you have an SBOM, platforms like &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a> can continuously monitor every component against vulnerability databases. CLI tools like &lt;a href="https://github.com/anchore/grype">Grype&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/">OSV-Scanner&lt;/a> provide point-in-time scanning, while &lt;a href="https://dependencytrack.org/">OWASP Dependency-Track&lt;/a> offers standalone continuous monitoring. See our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/02/01/sbom-scanning-vulnerability-detection/">SBOM scanning guide&lt;/a> for details and our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/resources/">resources page&lt;/a> for a complete list of tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Dependency relationship mapping.&lt;/strong> Both &lt;a href="https://cyclonedx.org/">CycloneDX&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://spdx.dev/">SPDX&lt;/a> support dependency relationship data, documenting which components depend on which others. This lets you trace the path from a vulnerable transitive dependency back to the direct dependency that brought it in.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>License tracking.&lt;/strong> Each dependency carries a license. SBOMs document these licenses, enabling automated compliance checking. A single &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/22/gpl-license-guide/">GPL-licensed&lt;/a> transitive dependency can trigger copyleft obligations for your entire application.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>SBOM generation tools like the &lt;a href="https://github.com/sbomify/github-action/">sbomify GitHub Action&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/anchore/syft">Syft&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy">Trivy&lt;/a> analyze lock files and build artifacts to capture the full dependency tree. For language-specific SBOM generation instructions, see our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/guides/">SBOM guides&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="best-practices">Best Practices&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Always use and commit lock files.&lt;/strong> Lock files ensure reproducible builds and prevent unexpected dependency changes. Review lock file diffs in pull requests to catch unintended dependency updates.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Audit your dependency tree regularly.&lt;/strong> Use &lt;code>npm audit&lt;/code>, &lt;code>pip-audit&lt;/code>, &lt;code>cargo audit&lt;/code>, or equivalent tools to check for known vulnerabilities. Do not limit auditing to direct dependencies — transitive vulnerabilities are equally dangerous.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Minimize your dependency footprint.&lt;/strong> Every dependency is a potential risk vector. Before adding a new package, evaluate whether the functionality justifies the added surface area. Prefer well-maintained libraries with active security response processes.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Generate and monitor SBOMs.&lt;/strong> Automate SBOM generation in your CI/CD pipeline and monitor SBOMs continuously against vulnerability databases. This catches newly disclosed CVEs in your existing dependencies. See our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/18/sbom-management-best-practices/">SBOM management guide&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Keep dependencies up to date.&lt;/strong> Apply security updates promptly, especially for dependencies listed in the &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/30/what-is-kev-cisa-known-exploited-vulnerabilities/">CISA KEV catalog&lt;/a>. Use tools like Dependabot or Renovate to automate update pull requests.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Review dependency changes.&lt;/strong> Treat dependency updates in pull requests with the same scrutiny as code changes. A bumped version may introduce new transitive dependencies, change licenses, or include unexpected modifications.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-a-dependency-in-software">What is a dependency in software?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A dependency is any external component — a library, framework, module, or package — that your application relies on to function. Dependencies are declared in manifest files (like &lt;code>package.json&lt;/code> or &lt;code>requirements.txt&lt;/code>) and installed from package registries (like npm or PyPI). They allow developers to reuse existing code rather than building everything from scratch.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-a-transitive-dependency">What is a transitive dependency?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A transitive dependency is a dependency of your dependency. If your project depends on package A, and package A depends on package B, then B is a transitive dependency of your project. Transitive dependencies are often invisible to developers but can contain vulnerabilities, restrictive licenses, or outdated code. They typically outnumber direct dependencies by a factor of 5-30x depending on the ecosystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-a-dependency-tree">What is a dependency tree?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A dependency tree (or dependency graph) is the complete hierarchy of all dependencies in a project, showing both direct and transitive relationships. It reveals the full set of code that your application actually uses at runtime. SBOM generation tools analyze dependency trees to produce complete component inventories.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-are-dependencies-a-security-risk">Why are dependencies a security risk?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Dependencies are a security risk because each one introduces code that your team did not write and may not audit. Known vulnerabilities in dependencies (CVEs) are a primary attack vector — incidents like Log4Shell affected millions of applications through a single widely-used library. Dependencies can also be intentionally compromised (as in the XZ Utils backdoor), abandoned by maintainers, or used in dependency confusion attacks.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-a-lock-file">What is a lock file?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A lock file records the exact resolved versions of all dependencies (direct and transitive) in a project. Examples include &lt;code>package-lock.json&lt;/code> (npm), &lt;code>poetry.lock&lt;/code> (Python), and &lt;code>Cargo.lock&lt;/code> (Rust). Lock files ensure reproducible builds — the same versions are installed every time, on every machine. They should always be committed to version control.&lt;/p></description><category>education</category></item><item><title>SBOM Generation Tools Compared: Syft, Trivy, cdxgen, and More</title><link>https://sbomify.com/2026/01/26/sbom-generation-tools-comparison/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sbomify.com/2026/01/26/sbom-generation-tools-comparison/</guid><description>&lt;p>SBOM generation tools analyze your software projects and produce machine-readable &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/what-is-sbom/">Software Bills of Materials&lt;/a> in standard formats like &lt;a href="https://cyclonedx.org/">CycloneDX&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://spdx.dev/">SPDX&lt;/a>. These tools scan dependency manifests, lock files, container images, and sometimes compiled binaries to create a complete inventory of every component in your software. Choosing the right tool depends on your programming language ecosystem, deployment model, output format requirements, and CI/CD integration needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-sbom-generation-tools-matter">Why SBOM Generation Tools Matter&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>SBOM generation is the foundation of the &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/resources/">SBOM lifecycle&lt;/a>. Without accurate generation, downstream activities — vulnerability monitoring, license compliance, supply chain risk management — have nothing to work with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Manual SBOM creation is not practical. A typical modern application has hundreds of dependencies, many of them &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/29/what-is-a-dependency-in-software/">transitive&lt;/a>. Automated tooling is the only reliable way to produce complete, accurate SBOMs at the pace of modern software development.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The SBOM generation tool landscape has matured significantly. Several open source tools now support dozens of package ecosystems, multiple output formats, and integration with CI/CD pipelines and container registries.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tool-comparison">Tool Comparison&lt;/h2>

&lt;h3 id="sbomify">sbomify&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a> is an open source SBOM platform that covers the full SBOM lifecycle: generation, augmentation, enrichment, storage, distribution, and vulnerability monitoring. Importantly, sbomify is not a standalone SBOM generator — the &lt;a href="https://github.com/sbomify/github-action/">sbomify GitHub Action&lt;/a> automatically selects the best generation tool for your ecosystem (such as Syft, cdxgen, or the CycloneDX ecosystem plugins) and then improves the quality of the generated SBOM through enrichment and augmentation. This means you get the most accurate generation for your stack, combined with metadata improvements that raw generators don&amp;rsquo;t provide — all in one step.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Strengths:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Uses the best underlying generator for each ecosystem, then enriches and augments the output&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Automatic metadata augmentation: adds supplier, manufacturer, and contact information to meet &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/ntia-minimum-elements/">NTIA minimum elements&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enrichment from 11+ data sources (deps.dev, ClearlyDefined, PyPI, crates.io, LicenseDB, and more) for license, hash, and lifecycle data&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Native CI/CD integration via &lt;a href="https://github.com/sbomify/github-action/">GitHub Action&lt;/a>, GitLab CI, and Bitbucket Pipelines&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Outputs both CycloneDX and SPDX formats&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Built-in vulnerability monitoring via Google OSV and OWASP Dependency-Track integration&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/features/trust-center/">Trust Center&lt;/a> for distributing SBOMs and compliance documents to customers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Supports all major ecosystems: Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, Rust, Ruby, PHP, .NET, Swift, Dart, Elixir, Scala, C/C++, Docker, Terraform, Yocto&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Considerations:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Not a standalone generator — it wraps and improves the output of other generation tools&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Full platform features (Trust Center, vulnerability monitoring) require the cloud service or self-hosted deployment&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;h3 id="syft">Syft&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/anchore/syft">Syft&lt;/a> is Anchore&amp;rsquo;s open source SBOM generation tool. It supports a broad range of package ecosystems and can scan source directories, container images (both local and from registries), and archive files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Strengths:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Wide ecosystem support: APK, DEB, RPM, npm, PyPI, Maven, Go, Rust, Ruby, PHP, and more&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Container image scanning with layer-by-layer analysis&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Outputs CycloneDX, SPDX 2.3, and its own Syft JSON format&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pairs naturally with &lt;a href="https://github.com/anchore/grype">Grype&lt;/a> for vulnerability scanning&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Active development with frequent releases&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Considerations:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Does not resolve dependency trees from source manifests as deeply as some language-specific tools&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No native vulnerability scanning (use Grype separately)&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy">Trivy&lt;/a> is Aqua Security&amp;rsquo;s comprehensive security scanner. While best known for vulnerability scanning, Trivy also generates SBOMs and can scan a wider range of targets than most dedicated SBOM tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Strengths:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Combined SBOM generation and vulnerability scanning in a single tool&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Scans source directories, container images, VM images, Kubernetes clusters, and IaC files&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Outputs CycloneDX and SPDX&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Detects both OS-level packages and language-specific dependencies&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Extensive ecosystem: npm, PyPI, Maven, Go, Rust, Ruby, NuGet, and more&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Considerations:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>SBOM generation is one feature among many; some SBOM-specific features may lag behind dedicated tools&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/CycloneDX/cdxgen">cdxgen&lt;/a> (CycloneDX Generator) is the official CycloneDX SBOM generation tool, maintained by the AppThreat team under the CycloneDX project. It focuses on deep analysis of language-specific dependency trees.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Strengths:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Deep dependency resolution for many ecosystems (Java, JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, .NET, Ruby, PHP, Swift, and more)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Generates evidence-based SBOMs with call graph analysis for supported languages&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Supports SBOM signing and attestation workflows&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Active development with rapid feature additions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Can generate SBOMs from container images and binary files&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Considerations:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>CycloneDX output only (no native SPDX support)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Requires Node.js runtime&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some advanced features (call graph analysis) require language-specific toolchain setup&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Considerations:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Language-specific: you need a different tool for each ecosystem in your stack&lt;/li>
&lt;li>CycloneDX format only&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Variable feature sets between language implementations&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>For a complete listing of language-specific tools and guides, see our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/guides/">SBOM generation guides&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/resources/">resources page&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="choosing-a-tool">Choosing a Tool&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="single-vs-multi-ecosystem">Single vs. Multi-Ecosystem&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If your organization uses a single language ecosystem, a language-specific CycloneDX plugin or SPDX tool will produce the most accurate results. If you work across multiple ecosystems (which most organizations do), a multi-ecosystem tool like &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a>, Syft, Trivy, or cdxgen provides consistency and simplifies CI/CD integration. If you also need SBOM management, vulnerability monitoring, and distribution, sbomify provides these in an integrated platform rather than requiring separate tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="format-requirements">Format Requirements&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you need CycloneDX output, all tools listed here support it except Microsoft SBOM Tool. If you need SPDX output, Syft, Trivy, and Microsoft SBOM Tool support it. If you need both, Syft and Trivy are the most flexible. For format conversion, the &lt;a href="https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-cli">CycloneDX CLI&lt;/a> can convert between formats.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>See our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/15/sbom-formats-cyclonedx-vs-spdx/">SBOM formats comparison&lt;/a> for help choosing a format.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="container-image-support">Container Image Support&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>For &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/03/container-security-best-practices/">container security&lt;/a> workflows, Syft and Trivy both provide strong container image scanning with layer-by-layer analysis. cdxgen also supports container images. Microsoft SBOM Tool does not scan container images directly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For Docker-specific SBOM generation instructions, see our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/guides/docker/">Docker SBOM guide&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="cicd-integration">CI/CD Integration&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>All major SBOM generation tools can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines. The &lt;a href="https://github.com/sbomify/github-action/">sbomify GitHub Action&lt;/a> provides a streamlined way to generate and manage SBOMs in GitHub workflows. Trivy and Syft both provide official GitHub Actions and support integration with most CI/CD platforms.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="benchmarking-sbom-tools">Benchmarking SBOM Tools&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Different tools may produce different results for the same project — varying in the number of components detected, the accuracy of version information, and the completeness of transitive dependency resolution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://github.com/sbomify/sbom-benchmarks">sbom-benchmarks repository&lt;/a> provides a framework for comparing SBOM generation tools against reference projects, along with examples of how to run each tool. Benchmarking against your own projects is the best way to evaluate which tool produces the most accurate and complete results for your specific technology stack.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="best-practices">Best Practices&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Generate SBOMs from resolved dependencies.&lt;/strong> Use lock files and build outputs rather than unresolved manifests. Lock files capture exact versions including transitive dependencies; manifests may contain version ranges that resolve differently in different environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Automate in CI/CD.&lt;/strong> Integrate SBOM generation into your build pipeline so every release automatically produces an SBOM. See our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/guides/">language-specific guides&lt;/a> for setup instructions.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Validate generated SBOMs.&lt;/strong> Use validation tools like the &lt;a href="https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-core-java">CycloneDX Validator&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://tools.spdx.org/app/validate/">SPDX Online Tools&lt;/a> to ensure your SBOMs conform to the specification. Invalid SBOMs may be rejected by consumers or analysis tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Combine tools for container SBOMs.&lt;/strong> A language-specific tool may miss OS-level packages in your container image. Use both a language-specific tool (for precise application dependency resolution) and a container scanner (for OS packages from the base image) to produce a complete picture.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Benchmark against your stack.&lt;/strong> Run multiple tools against your actual projects and compare the results. The best tool for a Python project may not be the best tool for a Java project.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Feed SBOMs into monitoring.&lt;/strong> SBOM generation is the starting point, not the end. Ingest generated SBOMs into a management platform like &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a> for integrated vulnerability monitoring, or use &lt;a href="https://dependencytrack.org/">OWASP Dependency-Track&lt;/a> for standalone analysis. See our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/18/sbom-management-best-practices/">SBOM management guide&lt;/a> for the full lifecycle.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="what-are-sbom-generation-tools">What are SBOM generation tools?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>SBOM generation tools are software that analyzes your projects — source code, dependency files, container images, or compiled binaries — and produces a machine-readable Software Bill of Materials in a standard format like CycloneDX or SPDX. Leading standalone generators include Syft (Anchore), Trivy (Aqua Security), cdxgen (CycloneDX), Microsoft SBOM Tool, and language-specific CycloneDX plugins. Platforms like &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a> wrap the best generator for your ecosystem and then enrich and augment the output for higher quality SBOMs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-the-best-sbom-generation-tool">What is the best SBOM generation tool?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There is no single best tool — the right choice depends on your ecosystems, format requirements, and workflow. For an integrated platform that selects the best generator for your ecosystem and then enriches, augments, and manages the output, &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a> covers the full lifecycle. For multi-ecosystem coverage with both CycloneDX and SPDX support as standalone CLI tools, Syft and Trivy are versatile options. For deep language-specific analysis, CycloneDX ecosystem plugins and cdxgen provide the most accurate results. For SPDX-only workflows integrated with Azure DevOps, Microsoft SBOM Tool is purpose-built.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-do-i-generate-an-sbom">How do I generate an SBOM?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Install an SBOM generation tool (Syft, Trivy, or cdxgen are good starting points for CLI use), point it at your project directory or container image, and specify your desired output format. For example: &lt;code>syft dir:. -o cyclonedx-json &amp;gt; sbom.json&lt;/code>. For production use, integrate SBOM generation into your CI/CD pipeline using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/sbomify/github-action/">sbomify GitHub Action&lt;/a>, which handles generation, enrichment, and augmentation in one step. See our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/guides/">language-specific SBOM guides&lt;/a> for detailed instructions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-format-should-my-sbom-be-in">What format should my SBOM be in?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Choose CycloneDX for security-focused use cases and SPDX for license compliance focus. For EU CRA compliance via BSI TR-03183-2, you need CycloneDX 1.6+ or SPDX 3.0.1+. Most other compliance frameworks accept both formats. See our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/15/sbom-formats-cyclonedx-vs-spdx/">SBOM formats comparison&lt;/a> for detailed guidance.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-do-i-validate-an-sbom">How do I validate an SBOM?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Use format-specific validation tools: the CycloneDX Validator for CycloneDX SBOMs and SPDX Online Tools for SPDX SBOMs. Validation checks structural correctness, required fields, and specification conformance. Additionally, tools like &lt;a href="https://github.com/interlynk-io/sbomqs">sbomqs&lt;/a> can score SBOM quality beyond basic structural validity.&lt;/p></description><category>education</category></item><item><title>Announcing sbomify v0.25: The One with Attestations</title><link>https://sbomify.com/2026/01/23/announcing-sbomify-v0-25-the-one-with-attestations/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sbomify.com/2026/01/23/announcing-sbomify-v0-25-the-one-with-attestations/</guid><description>&lt;p>Software supply chain security is not just about knowing what is in your software. It is about proving that knowledge is authentic and has not been tampered with. With v0.25, sbomify takes a significant step forward by introducing &lt;strong>attestation verification&lt;/strong>, allowing you to cryptographically verify the provenance of your SBOMs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="github-attestation-plugin">GitHub Attestation Plugin&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The headline feature of v0.25 is our new &lt;strong>GitHub Attestation Plugin&lt;/strong>. This plugin verifies SBOM attestations using &lt;a href="https://www.sigstore.dev/">Sigstore&lt;/a> and cosign, the same infrastructure that powers supply chain security across the open source ecosystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you generate an SBOM using GitHub Actions, you can sign it using GitHub&amp;rsquo;s built-in attestation capability. The sbomify GitHub Attestation Plugin then verifies these signatures automatically when you upload your SBOM. If the attestation is valid, you get cryptographic proof that the SBOM was generated by your CI/CD pipeline and has not been modified since.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The plugin includes automatic retry logic to handle transient network issues when communicating with the Sigstore transparency log. This ensures reliable verification even under less-than-ideal network conditions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is our first attestation plugin, building on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/sbomify/sbomify/blob/master/docs/ADR/ADR-003.md">plugin architecture&lt;/a> we introduced in v0.24. We plan to add support for additional attestation formats including in-toto in future releases.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="spdx-23-export">SPDX 2.3 Export&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>sbomify has supported uploading SBOMs in both CycloneDX and SPDX formats for a while. With v0.25, we are adding the ability to &lt;strong>download aggregated SBOMs in SPDX 2.3 format&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can now download aggregated SBOMs for releases, projects, and products in either CycloneDX or SPDX format directly from the UI. This gives you flexibility when working with tools and partners that prefer one format over the other. Internally, we continue to use CycloneDX as our canonical format, but the SPDX export ensures you can meet requirements regardless of which standard your ecosystem uses.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="product-lifecycle-management">Product Lifecycle Management&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Knowing when your software reaches end-of-support or end-of-life is critical for compliance and vulnerability management. v0.25 introduces &lt;strong>Product Lifecycle&lt;/strong> fields aligned with the &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/cle/">CLE (Common Lifecycle Enumeration)&lt;/a> standard that let you track:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Release Date&lt;/strong> - When the product version was released&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>End-of-Support Date&lt;/strong> - When active support ends&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>End-of-Life Date&lt;/strong> - When all support, including security updates, ends&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>You can set these dates manually in the UI for both &lt;strong>products&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>components&lt;/strong>. This is useful for tracking your own release schedules and support commitments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For common Linux distributions and frameworks, lifecycle data can also be added automatically. The &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/blog/2026/01/20/announcing-sbomify-action-v0-11-the-one-where-they-go-to-pypi/#know-when-your-software-goes-end-of-life">Lifecycle Database&lt;/a> in sbomify-action embeds CLE data directly into your SBOMs during generation. This covers distributions like Ubuntu, Debian, Alpine, and Fedora, as well as language runtimes and frameworks including Python, Go, Django, Rails, and React.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These dates flow through to your Trust Center and can be displayed on public product pages. For organizations subject to regulations like the &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/eu-cra/">EU Cyber Resilience Act&lt;/a>, tracking lifecycle information is a requirement.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="contact-role-flags">Contact Role Flags&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Building on the contact profile improvements from v0.24, this release adds &lt;strong>role flags&lt;/strong> to contacts. You can now designate contacts as:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Author&lt;/strong> - The person or team who created the component&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Security Contact&lt;/strong> - Who to reach for security issues&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Technical Contact&lt;/strong> - Who to reach for technical questions&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We have also consolidated the previously separate author field into the main contact profile. Instead of managing authors separately, you now simply mark a contact as an author using the role flag. This simplifies contact management while aligning with how CycloneDX represents contact information.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="compliance-badges">Compliance Badges&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Compliance status is now more visible than ever. v0.25 introduces &lt;strong>compliance badges&lt;/strong> that display assessment results directly on product listings and public Trust Center pages. Badges only appear for assessments you pass, so you are showcasing compliance achievements rather than advertising gaps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have also added a &lt;strong>Copy Badge&lt;/strong> button that generates markdown snippets you can paste into your README files. This makes it easy to showcase your compliance status directly in your repository.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="other-improvements">Other Improvements&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>CRA Plugin v1.1.0&lt;/strong> - The EU Cyber Resilience Act plugin now prioritizes native SBOM fields over &lt;code>cra:&lt;/code> annotations, making it easier to pass assessments without custom annotations&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Custom Domains&lt;/strong> - Added DCV (Domain Control Validation) delegation CNAME instructions for easier SSL certificate provisioning&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Architecture&lt;/strong> - Reorganized the codebase with cleaner api/domain/services layer separation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Billing&lt;/strong> - Enhanced billing processing and webhook handling for Stripe events (v0.25.1)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Django Admin&lt;/strong> - Comprehensive theme update to match the webapp design system (v0.25.1)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Footer&lt;/strong> - Simplified by removing version badges and moving build info to HTML comments (v0.25.1)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Fixed API error messages leaking team and resource information (security improvement)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fixed 403 errors when tagging SBOMs via API tokens in CI/CD pipelines&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fixed infinite &amp;ldquo;checking&amp;rdquo; state in the plugin UI when no plugins are enabled&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fixed RecursionError in public component page templates&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fixed plugin enable to not queue all historical SBOMs, which was blocking the web server (v0.25.1)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fixed social card images with proper 1200x630 dimensions and meta tags (v0.25.1)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fixed missing component context in component item view (v0.25.1)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fixed SPDX SBOMs not being tagged to releases (v0.25.1)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fixed social banner URLs for public Trust Center pages (v0.25.1)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To enable the GitHub Attestation Plugin, navigate to &lt;strong>Settings → Plugins&lt;/strong> and enable the GitHub Attestation assessment. From there, every SBOM upload with a valid attestation will be automatically verified.&lt;/p>

Install it anywhere with &lt;code>pip install sbomify-action&lt;/code> and generate enriched SBOMs on your laptop, in your build scripts, or wherever you need them. This release also tackles two of the biggest pain points in SBOM generation: missing license data and tracking end-of-life software.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="highlights">Highlights&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Use it anywhere&lt;/strong> - Install from PyPI and run locally, in CI, or in any workflow&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Fill in missing licenses&lt;/strong> - LicenseDB automatically adds license data for 28 Linux distro versions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Know when software goes EOL&lt;/strong> - Lifecycle Database tracks support dates for distros and frameworks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Choose your format&lt;/strong> - SPDX and CycloneDX with feature parity&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Prove what happened&lt;/strong> - Audit trail logs every SBOM transformation for compliance&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Rust projects welcome&lt;/strong> - Native generation and enrichment for the Rust ecosystem&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="never-miss-a-license-again">Never Miss a License Again&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of the most frustrating aspects of generating SBOMs for container images is discovering that half your packages are missing license information. This happens because many Linux distribution packages do not include machine-readable license metadata in their package manifests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>LicenseDB&lt;/strong> solves this. We have built a pre-computed database of valid package licenses covering 28 Linux distro versions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Debian (11, 12, 13)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ubuntu (20.04, 22.04, 24.04)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Alpine (3.13-3.21)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fedora (39, 40, 41, 42)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Amazon Linux (2, 2023)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>CentOS Stream (8, 9)&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Wolfi/Chainguard (rolling)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>When you generate an SBOM, LicenseDB automatically fills in license data for packages that would otherwise be missing it. The lookup is architecture-agnostic, so you get consistent results whether you are building for amd64 or arm64.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>LicenseDB is our primary license source, but not our only one. We integrate with multiple providers for license data, including PyPI, crates.io, and other package registries. LicenseDB is checked first because it is fast (downloaded once from GitHub releases then cached locally) and reliable. When LicenseDB does not have coverage for a package, we fall back to other sources. See our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/features/integrations/">integrations page&lt;/a> for the full list of data sources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We take a conservative approach: LicenseDB only includes licenses we can verify from authoritative sources. This means we do not have full coverage of every package, but we would rather provide a smaller, accurate database than try to guess licenses with heuristics. When it comes to license compliance, accuracy matters more than completeness.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="know-when-your-software-goes-end-of-life">Know When Your Software Goes End-of-Life&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Compliance frameworks like FedRAMP and SOC2 increasingly require organizations to demonstrate they are not running end-of-life software. But tracking EOL dates across dozens of components, base images, and frameworks is tedious and error-prone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The new &lt;strong>Lifecycle Database&lt;/strong> embeds &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/cle/">CLE (Common Lifecycle Enumeration)&lt;/a> data directly into your SBOMs, following the ECMA-428 specification. For every component we recognize, you get:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>What You Learn&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Why It Matters&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Release Date&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Know how old a component is&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>End of Support&lt;/td>
&lt;td>When bugfixes stop (security-only after this)&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>End of Life&lt;/td>
&lt;td>When all support ends, including security patches&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;h3 id="coverage">Coverage&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Linux Distributions&lt;/strong>: Alpine, Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux, Amazon Linux, CentOS Stream, Oracle Linux, openSUSE Leap, Wolfi&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Language Runtimes and Frameworks&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Python (2.7, 3.10-3.14)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>PHP (7.4, 8.0-8.5)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Go (1.22-1.25)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rust (1.90-1.92)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Django (4.2, 5.2, 6.0)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rails (7.0-8.1)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Laravel (10-13)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>React (17, 18, 19)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vue.js (2, 3)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>With this data in your SBOMs, you can answer questions like &amp;ldquo;Which of our containers are running EOL base images?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;When does Python 3.12 stop receiving security patches?&amp;rdquo; without leaving your SBOM tooling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is what the lifecycle data looks like in a CycloneDX SBOM:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Until now, sbomify-action lived exclusively in CI/CD pipelines. That made it hard to test configurations, debug issues, or generate SBOMs during local development.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With v0.11, install it from PyPI and run it wherever you need:&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The CLI supports both command-line flags and environment variables, so your existing CI configurations translate directly. Test locally, commit with confidence.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="choose-cyclonedx-or-spdx">Choose CycloneDX or SPDX&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Your supply chain partners may require SPDX. Your internal tooling may expect CycloneDX. You should not have to choose between them or accept a degraded experience with one format.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our goal is &lt;strong>feature parity between CycloneDX and SPDX&lt;/strong>. With v0.11, we have made significant progress:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>sbomify-action --lock-file requirements.txt -f spdx -o sbom.spdx.json
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>License sanitization, lifecycle data, and enrichment from all data sources now work identically regardless of output format. Whichever format your organization or supply chain partners require, you get the same high-quality, enriched SBOMs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="prove-what-happened-to-your-sbom">Prove What Happened to Your SBOM&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When auditors or customers ask how an SBOM was generated, you need to show your work. The new &lt;strong>audit trail&lt;/strong> logs every transformation applied during generation and enrichment, with timestamps.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>Enrichment&lt;/strong> - Per-component metadata additions (description, license, publisher, URLs)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Sanitization&lt;/strong> - PURL normalizations, URL validations, stub components added&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="output">Output&lt;/h3>

Generating an SBOM is only the first step. Without a management process, SBOMs become stale documents that sit unused. Effective SBOM management turns component inventories into an operational tool for vulnerability response, compliance reporting, and supply chain risk reduction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://sbomify.com/assets/images/d2/sbom-management-lifecycle.svg" alt="SBOM management lifecycle from generation through storage and monitoring to action">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-sbom-management-matters">Why SBOM Management Matters&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Most organizations that begin their SBOM journey focus on generation — using tools like &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/anchore/syft">Syft&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy">Trivy&lt;/a>, or &lt;a href="https://github.com/CycloneDX/cdxgen">cdxgen&lt;/a> to produce SBOMs from their projects (see our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/resources/">resources page&lt;/a> for a complete list). This is necessary but insufficient. An SBOM that is generated once and never updated or monitored provides little ongoing value.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The real benefits of SBOMs — rapid vulnerability response, continuous compliance, supply chain visibility — only materialize when SBOMs are actively managed. Consider the &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228">Log4Shell&lt;/a> disclosure in December 2021: organizations with up-to-date, searchable SBOMs identified affected systems in minutes. Organizations without them spent weeks manually auditing codebases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SBOM management addresses three challenges:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Scale.&lt;/strong> A mid-sized organization may have hundreds of applications, each with its own SBOM containing hundreds of components. Managing this manually is not feasible.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Currency.&lt;/strong> Software changes with every commit. SBOMs must be regenerated and updated to reflect the current state of deployed software.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Actionability.&lt;/strong> An SBOM is only useful if it can be queried, monitored, and correlated with new threat intelligence. Storage without analysis is archival, not management.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="the-sbom-lifecycle">The SBOM Lifecycle&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The SBOM lifecycle mirrors the structure outlined on our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/resources/">resources page&lt;/a>: generation, distribution, and analysis. Management spans all three phases.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="phase-1-generation">Phase 1: Generation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>SBOM generation should be automated in your CI/CD pipeline so that every build produces a current SBOM. Key considerations:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Format choice.&lt;/strong> Select &lt;a href="https://cyclonedx.org/">CycloneDX&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://spdx.dev/">SPDX&lt;/a> based on your compliance requirements and tooling. See our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/15/sbom-formats-cyclonedx-vs-spdx/">SBOM formats comparison&lt;/a> for guidance. Many organizations generate in both formats.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Generation point.&lt;/strong> Generate SBOMs at build time from resolved dependency trees (lock files, built artifacts), not from unresolved manifests. Build-time SBOMs capture the exact versions that will be deployed, including transitive dependencies.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Automation.&lt;/strong> Integrate SBOM generation into your CI/CD pipeline using tools like the &lt;a href="https://github.com/sbomify/github-action/">sbomify GitHub Action&lt;/a>. Every release should produce an SBOM automatically.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Completeness.&lt;/strong> Ensure SBOMs capture all layers. For &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/03/container-security-best-practices/">containerized applications&lt;/a>, this means generating container-level SBOMs that include base image packages in addition to application dependencies.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>For language-specific generation instructions, see our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/guides/">SBOM guides&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="phase-2-storage-and-versioning">Phase 2: Storage and Versioning&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Generated SBOMs need a durable, queryable storage location. Approaches range from simple to sophisticated:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Artifact repository.&lt;/strong> Store SBOMs alongside the build artifacts they describe. If you use a container registry, attach SBOMs to container images using OCI artifacts. If you use a package registry, publish SBOMs as companion files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Dedicated SBOM platform.&lt;/strong> Use a purpose-built platform like &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a> that ingests, indexes, and monitors SBOMs across your portfolio. sbomify organizes SBOMs in a hierarchy of Products, Projects, and Components — matching how software is actually built — and provides centralized visibility, search, and policy enforcement. Its &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/features/trust-center/">Trust Center&lt;/a> feature also handles distribution to customers and auditors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Version control.&lt;/strong> Each SBOM should be versioned in lockstep with the software it describes. When version 2.1.3 of your application is released, the SBOM for 2.1.3 should be generated and stored. Previous versions should be retained for audit and incident response purposes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Retention policy.&lt;/strong> Define how long SBOMs are retained. At minimum, retain SBOMs for all currently deployed versions. For compliance, retain SBOMs for the duration required by your applicable frameworks — the &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/eu-cra/">EU CRA&lt;/a> requires vulnerability handling for the expected product lifetime or a minimum of five years.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="phase-3-monitoring-and-analysis">Phase 3: Monitoring and Analysis&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This is where SBOMs deliver their highest value. Continuous monitoring matches your SBOM components against vulnerability databases and threat intelligence feeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Vulnerability monitoring.&lt;/strong> Ingest SBOMs into a management platform like &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a> (which integrates Google OSV and &lt;a href="https://dependencytrack.org/">OWASP Dependency-Track&lt;/a>) or a standalone instance of Dependency-Track. These platforms continuously match components against the &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/">NVD&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://osv.dev/">OSV&lt;/a>, and the &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">CISA KEV catalog&lt;/a>. When a new &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/18/cve-vulnerability-explained/">CVE&lt;/a> is published, the platform immediately identifies which of your products are affected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>License compliance.&lt;/strong> Monitor for license conflicts and policy violations. Automated tools can flag &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/22/gpl-license-guide/">GPL&lt;/a> dependencies in proprietary products, &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/07/apache-license-2-guide/">Apache 2.0 / GPLv2 incompatibilities&lt;/a>, or components with unknown licenses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Component lifecycle tracking.&lt;/strong> Monitor for end-of-life and end-of-support components. Dependencies that are no longer maintained represent a growing risk as new vulnerabilities go unpatched.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Policy enforcement.&lt;/strong> Define organizational policies (e.g., &amp;ldquo;no components with critical KEV-listed vulnerabilities in production,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;no AGPL-licensed components in SaaS products&amp;rdquo;) and monitor compliance across your portfolio.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="sbom-distribution">SBOM Distribution&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>SBOMs are not just internal documents. Increasingly, they must be shared with customers, regulators, and supply chain partners.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="who-receives-sboms">Who Receives SBOMs&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Customers&lt;/strong> requesting SBOMs as part of procurement or vendor assessment&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Regulators&lt;/strong> requiring SBOMs under frameworks like &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/eo-14028/">EO 14028&lt;/a> or the &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/eu-cra/">EU CRA&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Internal teams&lt;/strong> consuming software from other teams within the organization&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Auditors&lt;/strong> conducting security assessments or due diligence&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="distribution-methods">Distribution Methods&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Companion file.&lt;/strong> Publish the SBOM alongside the software release (e.g., in the GitHub release assets, alongside Docker images in a registry)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>API access.&lt;/strong> Provide programmatic access to SBOMs through a dedicated API endpoint&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Dedicated platform.&lt;/strong> Use an SBOM management platform like &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/features/trust-center/">sbomify&amp;rsquo;s Trust Center&lt;/a> that provides a branded portal with controlled access to SBOMs and compliance documents for authorized consumers&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="what-to-include">What to Include&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Follow the &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/ntia-minimum-elements/">NTIA minimum elements&lt;/a> as a baseline for SBOM content: supplier name, component name, component version, unique identifiers, dependency relationships, SBOM author, and timestamp. The &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/cisa-minimum-elements/">CISA minimum elements draft&lt;/a> adds recommended fields including license information and lifecycle/generation context.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="organizing-sboms-at-scale">Organizing SBOMs at Scale&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As the number of SBOMs grows, organization becomes critical.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="by-product-and-version">By Product and Version&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The most natural organization maps SBOMs to the products and versions they describe. Each product-version combination should have exactly one authoritative SBOM. For products composed of multiple services or components, consider a hierarchical approach: a top-level SBOM for the product that references component-level SBOMs for each service.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="by-deployment-environment">By Deployment Environment&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Different environments (development, staging, production) may run different versions. Track which SBOM corresponds to what is currently deployed in each environment. This is especially important for incident response — when a new vulnerability is disclosed, you need to know what is in production right now, not what was released last quarter.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="by-supply-chain-position">By Supply Chain Position&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you both consume and produce software, maintain SBOMs in both directions: SBOMs you receive from your suppliers (upstream) and SBOMs you generate for your products (downstream). Correlating upstream SBOMs with downstream products lets you trace how a supplier vulnerability propagates through your software.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="best-practices">Best Practices&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Automate generation in CI/CD.&lt;/strong> Never generate SBOMs manually. Integrate SBOM generation into your build pipeline so every release is automatically documented. See our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/guides/">SBOM generation guides&lt;/a> for language-specific instructions.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Monitor continuously.&lt;/strong> Set up automated vulnerability monitoring against your SBOMs. New CVEs are published daily; manual cross-referencing does not scale. &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a> provides integrated monitoring via Google OSV and OWASP Dependency-Track.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Version SBOMs with releases.&lt;/strong> Every software release should produce a corresponding SBOM. Store them together so you always know the component composition of any deployed version.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Define retention and distribution policies.&lt;/strong> Decide how long SBOMs are retained, who has access, and how they are shared with external consumers. Align retention with your compliance obligations.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Centralize visibility.&lt;/strong> As your SBOM inventory grows, centralize it in a platform that supports search, filtering, and cross-portfolio analysis. Being able to answer &amp;ldquo;which of our products use Log4j?&amp;rdquo; in seconds is the goal.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Keep SBOMs current.&lt;/strong> A stale SBOM is worse than no SBOM — it provides false confidence. Ensure that deployed software always has a corresponding current SBOM. Flag and investigate any deployed artifacts without an associated SBOM.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Act on findings.&lt;/strong> SBOM management is not complete without a remediation process. When monitoring surfaces a vulnerability, define SLAs for response based on severity, &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/30/what-is-kev-cisa-known-exploited-vulnerabilities/">KEV status&lt;/a>, and deployment context.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-sbom-management">What is SBOM management?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>SBOM management is the practice of organizing, storing, versioning, distributing, and continuously monitoring Software Bills of Materials across an organization&amp;rsquo;s software portfolio. It encompasses the entire SBOM lifecycle: automated generation in CI/CD, durable storage with version tracking, continuous vulnerability monitoring against databases like the NVD and CISA KEV, license compliance checking, and distribution to customers and regulators.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-is-sbom-management-important">Why is SBOM management important?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Generating an SBOM is only the first step. Without management, SBOMs quickly become stale and unused. SBOM management enables rapid vulnerability response (identifying affected products in seconds when a new CVE is disclosed), continuous compliance monitoring, and supply chain visibility at scale. Organizations with hundreds of applications and thousands of dependencies cannot manage software composition manually.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-tools-are-used-for-sbom-management">What tools are used for SBOM management?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Key tools include &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a> for integrated SBOM management (generation, storage, monitoring, and distribution in one platform), OWASP Dependency-Track for standalone vulnerability monitoring, and Grype for CLI-based scanning. For generation-only tools, Syft, Trivy, and cdxgen produce SBOMs in CycloneDX or SPDX format. For a comprehensive listing, see our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/resources/">SBOM resources page&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-often-should-sboms-be-updated">How often should SBOMs be updated?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>SBOMs should be regenerated with every software release and ideally with every build in your CI/CD pipeline. The SBOM for a deployed application should always reflect its current composition. Additionally, SBOMs should be continuously monitored against vulnerability databases, as new CVEs are published daily that may affect previously scanned components.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-should-be-included-in-an-sbom">What should be included in an SBOM?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>At minimum, follow the NTIA minimum elements: supplier name, component name, component version, unique identifiers (purl or CPE), dependency relationships, SBOM author, and timestamp. The CISA minimum elements draft adds license information and generation context.

Two formats have emerged as industry standards: &lt;a href="https://cyclonedx.org/">CycloneDX&lt;/a>, developed by OWASP, and &lt;a href="https://spdx.dev/">SPDX&lt;/a> (Software Package Data Exchange), developed by the Linux Foundation. Both are actively maintained, widely supported by tooling, and accepted by major compliance frameworks. Understanding their differences helps organizations choose the right format for their use case — or, as is increasingly common, support both.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="a-brief-history">A Brief History&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="spdx">SPDX&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>SPDX originated in 2010 as a Linux Foundation project focused on standardizing how open source license information is communicated. Its roots in license compliance shaped the format&amp;rsquo;s design: SPDX has always included rich fields for license expressions, copyright text, and file-level attribution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SPDX 2.0 was released in 2015. The later SPDX 2.2.1 became an &lt;a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/81870.html">ISO/IEC standard (5962:2021)&lt;/a> in 2021. SPDX 2.3, the current widely-deployed version, added support for additional relationship types and improved package identification.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.0.1/">SPDX 3.0&lt;/a>, released in 2024, is a significant redesign. It introduces a profile-based architecture where the core specification defines common elements and optional profiles (Security, Licensing, Build, AI, Dataset) extend the model for specific use cases. This makes SPDX 3.0 more flexible but also more complex than previous versions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="cyclonedx">CycloneDX&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>CycloneDX was created in 2017 by &lt;a href="https://owasp.org/">OWASP&lt;/a> with a different starting point: application security. The format was designed specifically to support software supply chain security use cases including vulnerability tracking, dependency analysis, and component integrity verification.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CycloneDX has evolved rapidly through regular releases. &lt;a href="https://cyclonedx.org/docs/1.6/">CycloneDX 1.6&lt;/a> (2024) added attestation and cryptography bill of materials support. &lt;a href="https://cyclonedx.org/docs/1.7/">CycloneDX 1.7&lt;/a> (2025) added patent and intellectual property metadata, citations for data provenance, enhanced cryptographic transparency capabilities, and expanded formulations scope.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CycloneDX is an &lt;a href="https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-424/">Ecma International standard (ECMA-424)&lt;/a> as of 2024.&lt;/p>

&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Both formats are open standards with active communities, public specification repositories, and contributor-friendly governance.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="key-structural-differences">Key Structural Differences&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="document-model">Document Model&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>CycloneDX&lt;/strong> uses a flat, component-centric model. An SBOM is a document containing metadata and a list of components. Dependencies are expressed separately through a &lt;code>dependencies&lt;/code> array that maps component references to their dependents. This separation keeps the component list clean and the dependency graph explicit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SPDX 2.3&lt;/strong> uses a package-and-relationship model. Packages are listed individually, and &lt;code>relationships&lt;/code> entries describe how they relate (e.g., &lt;code>DEPENDS_ON&lt;/code>, &lt;code>CONTAINS&lt;/code>, &lt;code>BUILD_TOOL_OF&lt;/code>). SPDX supports a wider set of relationship types than CycloneDX.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SPDX 3.0&lt;/strong> moves to an element-based model with a linked-data approach. Elements (packages, files, snippets, etc.) are connected through relationships and can reference external documents. This is more powerful for complex use cases but adds modeling complexity.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="component-identification">Component Identification&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Both formats support Package URL (&lt;a href="https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec">purl&lt;/a>) and &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe">CPE&lt;/a> for component identification. Purl is the preferred identifier in both ecosystems as it is more precise for software packages.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="license-data">License Data&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>SPDX has historically been stronger for license documentation, reflecting its origins. SPDX defines the &lt;a href="https://spdx.org/licenses/">SPDX License List&lt;/a> — the standard set of license identifiers (e.g., &lt;code>MIT&lt;/code>, &lt;code>Apache-2.0&lt;/code>, &lt;code>GPL-3.0-only&lt;/code>) used across the industry, including by CycloneDX.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CycloneDX supports license data through &lt;code>components[].licenses[]&lt;/code>, which can reference SPDX license identifiers or include full license text. Both formats support SPDX license expressions (compound expressions like &lt;code>MIT OR Apache-2.0&lt;/code>).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="vulnerability-data">Vulnerability Data&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>CycloneDX&lt;/strong> includes a dedicated &lt;code>vulnerabilities&lt;/code> array at the document level, allowing SBOMs to carry vulnerability information alongside component data. This is useful for creating Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) documents and for attaching vulnerability assessments directly to SBOMs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SPDX 2.3&lt;/strong> does not have a native vulnerability data structure. Vulnerability information must be conveyed through external references or separate documents.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SPDX 3.0&lt;/strong> introduces a Security profile that adds vulnerability and VEX support, closing this gap.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="lifecycle-and-build-data">Lifecycle and Build Data&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>CycloneDX 1.7&lt;/strong> includes &lt;code>metadata.lifecycles[].phase&lt;/code> to indicate when the SBOM was generated (design, pre-build, build, post-build, operations, discovery, decommission). This aligns with the &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/types-software-bill-materials-sbom">CISA SBOM types taxonomy&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SPDX 3.0&lt;/strong> supports build information through its Build profile, which can document build system, build commands, and build environment details.&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> }
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> ]
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span> }

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>}
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Both formats express the same information — a component named &lt;code>lodash&lt;/code> at version &lt;code>4.17.21&lt;/code>, licensed under MIT. CycloneDX uses a more compact syntax; SPDX 2.3 requires additional fields like &lt;code>downloadLocation&lt;/code>, &lt;code>SPDXID&lt;/code>, and &lt;code>documentNamespace&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="when-to-use-which-format">When to Use Which Format&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There is no single &amp;ldquo;winner&amp;rdquo; between CycloneDX and SPDX. The right choice depends on your primary use case:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Choose CycloneDX when:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Your primary concern is application security and vulnerability management&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You need to include vulnerability or VEX data directly in the SBOM&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You are targeting EU CRA compliance and prefer the more compact format&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your toolchain already uses CycloneDX-native tools like cdxgen&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You want a simpler document model with fewer required fields&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Choose SPDX when:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>License compliance is your primary driver&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You need detailed file-level analysis (SPDX supports file and snippet elements)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You are working in ecosystems that have standardized on SPDX (e.g., some automotive and embedded Linux communities)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You need ISO/IEC standard status (ISO/IEC 5962:2021)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You are working with SPDX 3.0 profiles for specialized use cases (AI, Build, Dataset)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Support both when:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You distribute software to diverse customers with different format preferences&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your compliance obligations span multiple frameworks with different preferences&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You use tools like Syft or Trivy that generate both formats from a single scan&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Many organizations generate SBOMs in both formats or convert between them using tools like the &lt;a href="https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-cli">CycloneDX CLI&lt;/a>. The formats are converging in capability, and the practical differences are narrowing with each release.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="what-are-the-main-sbom-formats">What are the main SBOM formats?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The two industry-standard SBOM formats are CycloneDX (developed by OWASP, standardized as ECMA-424) and SPDX (developed by the Linux Foundation, standardized as ISO/IEC 5962:2021). Both support JSON and XML serialization, are accepted by major compliance frameworks, and have broad tooling support. CycloneDX originated in application security; SPDX originated in license compliance.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-cyclonedx-and-spdx">What is the difference between CycloneDX and SPDX?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>CycloneDX is a security-focused format with a compact, component-centric model and native support for vulnerability and VEX data. SPDX is a compliance-focused format with rich license documentation capabilities and support for file-level and snippet-level analysis. CycloneDX has a simpler document structure; SPDX (especially 3.0) offers a more flexible element-based model with profiles for specialized use cases. Both support purl, CPE, and hash-based component identification.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="which-sbom-format-should-i-use">Which SBOM format should I use?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If your primary concern is application security and vulnerability management, CycloneDX is often the more straightforward choice. If license compliance is your primary driver, SPDX&amp;rsquo;s deeper license support may be more appropriate. For EU CRA compliance via BSI TR-03183-2, you need CycloneDX 1.6+ or SPDX 3.0.1+ in JSON or XML format. Many organizations support both formats, as most modern tools can generate either.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="can-i-convert-between-cyclonedx-and-spdx">Can I convert between CycloneDX and SPDX?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Yes. Tools like the CycloneDX CLI support conversion between formats. However, conversion may result in some data loss where one format supports fields that the other does not. For critical compliance use cases, it is better to generate natively in the required format rather than converting.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-an-sbom-example">What is an SBOM example?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>An SBOM is a machine-readable document listing every component in a software product, including names, versions, package identifiers (purl), licenses, and supplier information. See the CycloneDX and SPDX JSON examples in this article for minimal working examples. For real-world SBOMs with hundreds of components, see the &lt;a href="https://github.com/sbomify/sbom-benchmarks">sbom-benchmarks repository&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description><category>education</category></item><item><title>Announcing sbomify v0.24: The One with All the Plugins</title><link>https://sbomify.com/2026/01/14/announcing-sbomify-v0-24-the-one-with-all-the-plugins/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sbomify.com/2026/01/14/announcing-sbomify-v0-24-the-one-with-all-the-plugins/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today marks a pivotal release for sbomify. With v0.24, we are laying the foundation for what will become a fully extensible, plugin-based platform. This release introduces our new &lt;strong>Plugin-Based Assessment Framework&lt;/strong>, a unified architecture for running automated assessments on every SBOM upload. This represents a fundamental shift in how we think about sbomify&amp;rsquo;s architecture going forward.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="plugin-based-assessment-framework">Plugin-Based Assessment Framework&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The headline feature of v0.24 is our new assessment plugin system, documented in &lt;a href="https://github.com/sbomify/sbomify/blob/master/docs/ADR/ADR-003.md">ADR-003: Plugin-based Assessments for SBOM Uploads&lt;/a>. If you want to understand where sbomify is headed, this architectural decision record is essential reading.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="four-assessment-categories">Four Assessment Categories&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The plugin framework is designed to support four distinct categories of SBOM assessment:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Category&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Description&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Examples&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;strong>Security&lt;/strong>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Vulnerability scanning via external tools and APIs&lt;/td>
&lt;td>OSV, Dependency-Track&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;strong>License&lt;/strong>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Policy evaluation against approved/denied license lists&lt;/td>
&lt;td>License policy checks&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;strong>Compliance&lt;/strong>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Validation against regulatory and industry standards&lt;/td>
&lt;td>NTIA, CISA, CRA, FDA&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;strong>Attestation&lt;/strong>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Integrity and provenance verification&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Sigstore, in-toto&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Each category has different characteristics. Security plugins integrate with external vulnerability databases that change continuously, so they support scheduled re-runs. Compliance and license plugins are deterministic for a given ruleset version. Attestation plugins verify cryptographic signatures and provenance data.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="compliance-plugins-shipping-now">Compliance Plugins Shipping Now&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This release ships with five compliance plugins ready to use. Each plugin aligns with our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/">compliance documentation&lt;/a>, so you can understand exactly what is being validated:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/ntia-minimum-elements/">NTIA Minimum Elements&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> - Validates your SBOMs against the foundational US baseline for SBOM data fields&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/cisa-minimum-elements/">CISA 2025 Minimum Elements&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> - Checks compliance with the updated US guidance including hash, license, and generation context&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/eu-cra/">EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> - Validates against Regulation 2024/2847 requirements (beta)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/fda-medical-device/">FDA Medical Device Cybersecurity&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> - Ensures medical device SBOM requirements are met, including lifecycle properties&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Checksum Verification&lt;/strong> - A test plugin that validates SBOM integrity through checksum verification (useful as a reference implementation)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Each plugin runs automatically when you upload an SBOM. Simply enable the plugins you need in &lt;strong>Settings → Plugins&lt;/strong>, and assessments happen transparently in the background.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-this-architecture-matters">Why This Architecture Matters&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The design decisions in ADR-003 are intentional and set the stage for everything that follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Assessments tied to uploads, not content hashes&lt;/strong> - Each upload is assessed independently, giving you a complete history of checks over time&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Immutable AssessmentRun records&lt;/strong> - Every assessment is recorded permanently, enabling full audit trails and historical tracking&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Python SDK with normalized results&lt;/strong> - All plugins return results in a consistent &lt;code>AssessmentResult&lt;/code> schema with &lt;code>Finding&lt;/code> entries, making it easy to compare and aggregate data across plugin types&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Config hashing for reproducibility&lt;/strong> - When assessment results change, you can trace exactly why by comparing configuration hashes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Per-team plugin enablement&lt;/strong> - Teams can enable the plugins relevant to their needs, with feature gating based on billing plans&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="the-migration-path">The Migration Path&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This plugin system is the future of sbomify. In upcoming releases, we will be migrating our existing features into this architecture:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Phase 2: Security Plugins&lt;/strong>
Our current &lt;strong>OSV vulnerability scanning&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Dependency Track integration&lt;/strong> will be refactored into security plugins. This migration will make these features more modular, give you historical tracking of all vulnerability scans, and allow the same plugin architecture to power scheduled re-scans as vulnerability databases are updated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Phase 3 and Beyond&lt;/strong>
We have a roadmap of additional plugins including license policy evaluation, attestation verification (Sigstore and in-toto), and VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange) statement processing. The goal is to make sbomify a platform where you can mix and match the capabilities you need.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="vuejs-to-alpinejs-migration-complete">Vue.js to Alpine.js Migration Complete&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We have completed the frontend migration we started in previous releases. This release replaces the remaining &lt;strong>35 Vue.js components&lt;/strong> with lightweight Alpine.js implementations backed by Django templates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This migration closes out &lt;a href="https://github.com/sbomify/sbomify/blob/master/docs/ADR/ADR-001.md">ADR-001: Django Monolith&lt;/a>. As documented there, our detour into Vue turned out to be a mistake. While we wanted to maintain an API-first approach, leveraging Django Templates with server-side rendering minimizes complexity compared to a separate Vue frontend. Equally important, Vue made end-to-end testing more challenging, and we had several blocks silently failing as a result.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The result is a significantly smaller bundle size, faster page loads, a more maintainable codebase, and much better test coverage. If you have been following our journey from Vue.js to Alpine.js + HTMX, this release marks the finish line.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="contact-profiles-cyclonedx-alignment">Contact Profiles CycloneDX Alignment&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Contact profiles have been restructured to align with the CycloneDX specification. The new &lt;strong>3-level hierarchy&lt;/strong> (Profile → Entity → Contact) matches how CycloneDX represents organizational and contact information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have existing contact profiles, they will be automatically migrated to the new structure. No action required on your part.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="billing-system-improvements">Billing System Improvements&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We have made several improvements to how billing works:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Dynamic pricing from Stripe&lt;/strong> - Pricing is now synced directly from Stripe, ensuring consistency across the platform&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Promotion codes at checkout&lt;/strong> - You can now apply promotion codes when subscribing or upgrading&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Billing period visibility&lt;/strong> - Your current billing period and next billing date are now displayed in team settings&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improved subscription management&lt;/strong> - New management commands for subscription reconciliation and better webhook handling&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="other-improvements">Other Improvements&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Trust Center&lt;/strong>: Consolidated templates, improved SEO, and better UX across the board&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>CycloneDX 1.6+&lt;/strong>: Added manufacturer field support with backward compatibility for 1.5&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>CI/CD Templates&lt;/strong>: New configuration templates for Azure DevOps and Jenkins&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>License Expressions&lt;/strong>: Optimized parsing with server-side rendering support&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mobile Experience&lt;/strong>: Improved search bar responsiveness on mobile devices&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Document Upload&lt;/strong>: Better drag-and-drop experience&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Workspace Labels&lt;/strong>: Now use title case (Product, Compliance Artifact, Project)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="security-and-infrastructure">Security and Infrastructure&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On the security front, we addressed findings from Semgrep and Bandit scans, added &lt;code>noreferrer&lt;/code> to external links, and fixed a user invitation limit bypass vulnerability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Infrastructure updates include upgrading our base image to &lt;strong>Debian Trixie&lt;/strong>, updating &lt;code>python-keycloak&lt;/code> to 7.0.1, and bumping our GitHub Actions dependencies to their latest versions.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Fixed duplicate artifacts appearing in release pages when components belong to multiple projects&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fixed barcode rendering on private product identifiers page&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fixed latest badge display and modal issues in release UI&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fixed private component access returning 404 instead of 403 Forbidden&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fixed &lt;code>$schema&lt;/code> alias handling in CycloneDX SBOM serialization&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fixed domain verification cron job registration&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you are self-hosting sbomify, update to v0.24 to take advantage of the new plugin system. For users on our hosted platform, these features are already live.&lt;/p>

SCA tools work by analyzing dependency manifests, lock files, and sometimes compiled binaries to produce an inventory of components that can be matched against vulnerability databases like the &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/">National Vulnerability Database&lt;/a> (NVD) and the &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">CISA KEV catalog&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://sbomify.com/assets/images/d2/sca-workflow.svg" alt="SCA workflow from source analysis through component identification to vulnerability matching">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-software-composition-analysis">What Is Software Composition Analysis?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Software Composition Analysis addresses a fundamental reality of modern software development: most applications are not written from scratch. Studies consistently show that &lt;a href="https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/estimating-total-number-linux-contributors-approach-using-linus-law/">70-90% of a typical application consists of open source components&lt;/a> pulled from package registries like npm, PyPI, Maven Central, and crates.io. Each of these components introduces potential security vulnerabilities, license obligations, and maintenance risks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SCA tools automate the process of identifying these components and their associated risks. Without SCA, development teams would need to manually track every library version across every project — an approach that does not scale given the pace of vulnerability disclosure (the NVD published over 28,000 CVEs in 2023 alone).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The core functions of SCA are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Component identification.&lt;/strong> Scanning source code, dependency files, and sometimes binaries to produce a complete inventory of third-party components, including &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/29/what-is-a-dependency-in-software/">transitive dependencies&lt;/a> — the dependencies of your dependencies.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Vulnerability detection.&lt;/strong> Matching identified components against vulnerability databases to flag known &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/18/cve-vulnerability-explained/">CVEs&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>License compliance.&lt;/strong> Identifying the license of each component and flagging potential conflicts or compliance obligations, such as &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/22/gpl-license-guide/">GPL copyleft requirements&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Policy enforcement.&lt;/strong> Allowing organizations to define rules (e.g., &amp;ldquo;block any component with a critical CVE&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;reject AGPL-licensed dependencies&amp;rdquo;) and enforce them in CI/CD pipelines.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="how-sca-tools-work">How SCA Tools Work&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>SCA tools typically operate through one or more of these analysis methods:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="manifest-and-lock-file-analysis">Manifest and Lock File Analysis&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The most common approach. SCA tools parse dependency declaration files — &lt;code>package.json&lt;/code> and &lt;code>package-lock.json&lt;/code> (JavaScript), &lt;code>requirements.txt&lt;/code> and &lt;code>poetry.lock&lt;/code> (Python), &lt;code>pom.xml&lt;/code> (Java), &lt;code>go.sum&lt;/code> (Go), &lt;code>Cargo.lock&lt;/code> (Rust), and similar files for other ecosystems. This provides a definitive list of declared dependencies and their resolved versions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="source-code-scanning">Source Code Scanning&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Some SCA tools scan source code files to detect component usage that may not be declared in manifests — for example, vendored code (source files copied directly into a repository rather than managed through a package manager), or code snippets pulled from Stack Overflow or other sources.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="binary-analysis">Binary Analysis&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Binary SCA analyzes compiled artifacts (executables, container images, firmware) to identify embedded components. This is essential when source code is not available, such as when evaluating third-party commercial software or auditing firmware. Binary analysis is less precise than manifest analysis but covers a broader set of use cases.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="dependency-resolution">Dependency Resolution&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Advanced SCA tools resolve the full dependency tree, including transitive dependencies. A project that declares 10 direct dependencies may actually depend on hundreds of transitive packages. SCA tools that only examine direct dependencies miss the majority of the attack surface.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="sca-vs-sast-vs-dast">SCA vs. SAST vs. DAST&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>SCA is one of several application security testing approaches. Each addresses different risk categories and operates at different points in the &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/15/software-development-life-cycle-sdlc-sbom-integration/">software development life cycle&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>

&lt;td>Does not find dependency vulnerabilities&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Does not find issues in code paths not exercised&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>These tools are complementary. A comprehensive application security program uses all three:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>SCA&lt;/strong> catches known vulnerabilities in the 70-90% of your application that you did not write&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>SAST&lt;/strong> catches coding flaws in the 10-30% that you did write&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>DAST&lt;/strong> catches runtime issues that only manifest in a deployed environment&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="sca-tools">SCA Tools&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Several tools provide SCA capabilities. The ecosystem spans open source and commercial offerings.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="sca-and-sboms">SCA and SBOMs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>SCA tools and &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/what-is-sbom/">SBOMs&lt;/a> are closely related but serve different purposes. Understanding the relationship helps you build a more effective security program.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="sca-generates-sboms">SCA Generates SBOMs&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Many SCA tools produce SBOMs as an output of their analysis. The &lt;a href="https://github.com/sbomify/github-action/">sbomify GitHub Action&lt;/a> generates SBOMs and automatically enriches them with license, hash, and lifecycle metadata from 11+ data sources. Standalone tools like &lt;a href="https://github.com/anchore/syft">Syft&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy">Trivy&lt;/a> also generate SBOMs in standard formats (&lt;a href="https://cyclonedx.org/">CycloneDX&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://spdx.dev/">SPDX&lt;/a>). In this sense, SCA is one of the primary methods for &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/guides/">SBOM generation&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="sboms-enable-continuous-sca">SBOMs Enable Continuous SCA&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A generated SBOM can be ingested by management platforms like &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://dependencytrack.org/">OWASP Dependency-Track&lt;/a> for continuous analysis. Instead of re-scanning your entire codebase every time a new CVE is published, the platform matches new vulnerabilities against your existing SBOM inventory. This is particularly valuable for monitoring production deployments where source code may not be readily accessible.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="sboms-go-beyond-sca">SBOMs Go Beyond SCA&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>While SCA focuses on vulnerability detection and license compliance, SBOMs serve a broader purpose:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Regulatory compliance.&lt;/strong> Frameworks like &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/eo-14028/">Executive Order 14028&lt;/a>, the &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/eu-cra/">EU Cyber Resilience Act&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/fda-medical-device/">FDA medical device guidance&lt;/a> require SBOMs as a compliance artifact — not just SCA scan results.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Supply chain transparency.&lt;/strong> SBOMs document the provenance and composition of software for consumers, auditors, and regulators.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Incident response.&lt;/strong> When a vulnerability like &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228">Log4Shell&lt;/a> is disclosed, SBOMs allow you to immediately identify affected products without re-running scans.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>For organizations building a security program, SCA tools are the engine and SBOMs are the artifact. Use SCA to scan and detect; use SBOMs to document, share, and continuously monitor.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="best-practices">Best Practices&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Integrate SCA into CI/CD.&lt;/strong> Run SCA scans on every build and pull request. Catching vulnerable dependencies before they reach production is far less costly than remediating them after deployment.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Monitor continuously, not just at build time.&lt;/strong> New vulnerabilities are disclosed daily. Use SBOM-based monitoring with platforms like &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://dependencytrack.org/">OWASP Dependency-Track&lt;/a> to catch newly disclosed CVEs in your already-deployed components.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Resolve the full dependency tree.&lt;/strong> Ensure your SCA tool analyzes transitive dependencies, not just direct ones. The majority of vulnerable components in most projects are transitive.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Define and enforce policies.&lt;/strong> Establish clear rules for vulnerability severity thresholds, license restrictions, and acceptable risk. Automate enforcement in your pipeline to prevent policy violations from reaching production.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Combine SCA with SAST and DAST.&lt;/strong> SCA only finds known vulnerabilities in third-party code. Pair it with SAST for your own code and DAST for runtime testing to cover all three risk categories.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Generate SBOMs from SCA output.&lt;/strong> Use your SCA tool&amp;rsquo;s SBOM generation capability to produce machine-readable component inventories in &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/15/sbom-formats-cyclonedx-vs-spdx/">CycloneDX or SPDX format&lt;/a>. These SBOMs serve both security monitoring and compliance purposes.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-software-composition-analysis-1">What is software composition analysis?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is a category of security tooling that identifies open source and third-party components in your software, detects known vulnerabilities in those components by matching them against databases like the NVD, and catalogs their licenses for compliance purposes. SCA tools analyze dependency manifests, lock files, and sometimes binaries to produce a complete component inventory.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-sca-and-sast">What is the difference between SCA and SAST?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>SCA analyzes third-party and open source components in your application for known vulnerabilities and license issues. SAST (Static Application Security Testing) analyzes your own source code for coding flaws like injection vulnerabilities, authentication bypasses, and logic errors. SCA covers the 70-90% of your application that is third-party code; SAST covers the code you wrote yourself. Both are needed for comprehensive application security.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-does-sca-relate-to-sboms">How does SCA relate to SBOMs?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>SCA tools are one of the primary methods for generating SBOMs. When an SCA tool scans your project and identifies all components, that inventory can be exported as an SBOM in standard formats like CycloneDX or SPDX. Conversely, SBOMs enable continuous SCA by providing a persistent component inventory that can be monitored against new vulnerability disclosures without re-scanning source code.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-are-the-best-open-source-sca-tools">What are the best open source SCA tools?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Leading open source SCA tools include Grype (vulnerability scanner from Anchore), OWASP Dependency-Track (continuous SBOM analysis platform), OWASP Dependency-Check (mature CVE detection tool), OSV-Scanner (Google&amp;rsquo;s vulnerability scanner using the OSV database), and Trivy (comprehensive scanner from Aqua Security). Choice depends on your ecosystem, integration requirements, and whether you need CLI scanning, CI/CD integration, or continuous monitoring.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="does-sca-find-all-vulnerabilities">Does SCA find all vulnerabilities?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>No. SCA finds known vulnerabilities in third-party components — those that have been assigned CVE identifiers and added to vulnerability databases. It does not find zero-day vulnerabilities (those not yet publicly known), vulnerabilities in your own code, or runtime configuration issues. SCA should be combined with SAST, DAST, and penetration testing for comprehensive coverage.&lt;/p></description><category>education</category></item><item><title>FDA Medical Device SBOM Requirements: What the New Cybersecurity Guidance Means for Manufacturers</title><link>https://sbomify.com/2026/01/09/fda-medical-device-sbom-requirements/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sbomify.com/2026/01/09/fda-medical-device-sbom-requirements/</guid><description>&lt;p>On June 27, 2025, the FDA issued updated guidance on &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;Cybersecurity in Medical Devices: Quality System Considerations and Content of Premarket Submissions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong> This document marks a significant step forward in how medical device manufacturers must approach software security and transparency. At the heart of these recommendations lies the &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/what-is-sbom/">Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)&lt;/a> — now an essential element of premarket submissions for connected medical devices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re a manufacturer preparing a 510(k), PMA, or other premarket submission, here&amp;rsquo;s what you need to know about the FDA&amp;rsquo;s SBOM expectations and how to prepare.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-the-guidance-says-about-sboms">What the Guidance Says About SBOMs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The FDA guidance recommends the inclusion of an SBOM under &lt;strong>Section V.A.4 (Software Bill of Materials)&lt;/strong> as part of cybersecurity documentation in premarket submissions. Additionally, &lt;strong>Appendix 4&lt;/strong> lists SBOM sections as recommended documentation when cybersecurity risk is relevant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the guidance language is technically &lt;strong>non-binding&lt;/strong> (&amp;ldquo;contains nonbinding recommendations&amp;rdquo;), the practical reality is different:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Under &lt;strong>Section 524B of the FD&amp;amp;C Act&lt;/strong>, the FDA has authority over &amp;ldquo;cyber devices&amp;rdquo; — devices with software that can be vulnerable and are connected&lt;/li>
&lt;li>FDA may &lt;strong>refuse to accept premarket submissions&lt;/strong> that do not provide adequate SBOM and related cybersecurity information&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Insufficient SBOM documentation can lead to &lt;strong>delays in review&lt;/strong> or requests for resubmission&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In practice, the SBOM has moved from &amp;ldquo;nice-to-have&amp;rdquo; to &lt;strong>essential cybersecurity documentation&lt;/strong> for medical device submissions. This mirrors the broader global trend toward &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/features/why-now/">mandatory SBOM requirements&lt;/a> across regulatory frameworks.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="sbom-content-expectations">SBOM Content Expectations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The FDA guidance does not define SBOM fields directly. Instead, it explicitly references the &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.ntia.gov/sites/default/files/publications/sbom_minimum_elements_report_0.pdf">NTIA Minimum Elements for a Software Bill of Materials&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> as the baseline expectation for SBOM content in premarket submissions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This distinction matters: the FDA is effectively saying &amp;ldquo;provide an SBOM that meets the NTIA minimum elements&amp;rdquo; — not &amp;ldquo;provide an SBOM with these FDA-defined fields.&amp;rdquo; This approach mirrors how other regulators (including the EU&amp;rsquo;s Cyber Resilience Act) reference SBOMs indirectly via standards bodies, allowing requirements to evolve without requiring agencies to reissue guidance.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="ntia-minimum-elements">NTIA Minimum Elements&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The NTIA baseline defines what every SBOM should contain. For each software component:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Supplier name&lt;/strong> — who supplied the component&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Component name&lt;/strong> — the name of the component&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Version&lt;/strong> — the version identifier&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Unique identifier&lt;/strong> — such as Package URL (purl) or CPE&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Dependency relationship&lt;/strong> — how components relate to each other&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Author of SBOM data&lt;/strong> — who created the SBOM&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Timestamp&lt;/strong> — when the SBOM was created&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="machine-readable-formats">Machine-Readable Formats&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>SBOMs should be provided in machine-readable formats that support the NTIA minimum elements:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>SPDX&lt;/strong> (Software Package Data Exchange)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>CycloneDX&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Both formats are widely accepted and can represent the required NTIA data fields.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="complete-software-inventory">Complete Software Inventory&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>All software included in the device must be identified:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Commercial software&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Open-source components&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Third-party libraries&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Off-the-shelf (OTS) components&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="support-and-lifecycle-metadata">Support and Lifecycle Metadata&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Beyond the NTIA baseline, FDA expects additional context for medical device submissions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Level of support&lt;/strong> from the component supplier (active, legacy, or unsupported)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>End-of-support and end-of-life dates&lt;/strong> for each component&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="vulnerability-context">Vulnerability Context&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>SBOMs should be supplemented with:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A &lt;strong>known vulnerabilities assessment&lt;/strong> for identified components&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Controls or mitigation descriptions&lt;/strong> explaining whether vulnerabilities are mitigated by design&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This means SBOMs are expected to be part of a comprehensive &lt;strong>vulnerability and risk management package&lt;/strong>, not just a flat inventory list.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lifecycle-and-traceability-requirements">Lifecycle and Traceability Requirements&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The FDA guidance ties SBOMs into broader cybersecurity documentation expectations throughout the device lifecycle. Understanding the full &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/features/generate-collaborate-analyze/">SBOM lifecycle&lt;/a> — from generation through distribution and analysis — is critical for FDA compliance:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="secure-product-development-and-traceability">Secure Product Development and Traceability&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>SBOMs must be &lt;strong>traceable to security architecture views&lt;/strong> and threat models that FDA reviewers evaluate&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The documentation should demonstrate how software components affect device security risks&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="ongoing-updates">Ongoing Updates&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>SBOMs should be &lt;strong>updated to reflect changes&lt;/strong> throughout software updates and the device lifecycle&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This is not a one-time snapshot — it&amp;rsquo;s a living document&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Proper &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/guides/how-to-version-sboms">SBOM versioning practices&lt;/a> are essential for maintaining traceability&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="integration-with-other-documentation">Integration with Other Documentation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In premarket submissions, SBOMs typically appear alongside:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Security Risk Management Reports&lt;/strong> — showing how components affect device risks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Vulnerability Assessments&lt;/strong> — outcomes derived from SBOM analysis&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Software Support Information&lt;/strong> — lifecycle and maintenance details&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Labeling and Transparency Materials&lt;/strong> — cybersecurity information for end users&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="why-cicd-integration-is-essential">Why CI/CD Integration Is Essential&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Given the FDA&amp;rsquo;s emphasis on traceability and ongoing updates, &lt;strong>manual SBOM generation is not sustainable&lt;/strong> for medical device compliance. Every software build should automatically generate an SBOM that:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Captures the exact components at the moment of build&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Is cryptographically linked to that specific release&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Can be traced back to source code and build artifacts&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Is automatically stored and versioned for audit trails&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Integrating SBOM generation into your CI/CD pipeline ensures that every release — whether it&amp;rsquo;s a major version update or a security patch — has accurate, reproducible documentation. This is particularly important for medical devices where you may need to answer FDA questions about software composition years after the initial submission.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="distribution-and-transparency">Distribution and Transparency&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The FDA expects manufacturers to share cybersecurity information with stakeholders, including healthcare providers and end users. This means having a reliable system for distributing SBOMs to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>FDA reviewers during premarket submissions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Auditors during compliance assessments&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Healthcare organizations evaluating your devices&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Security researchers conducting vulnerability assessments&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Email and shared drives don&amp;rsquo;t scale for this — you need a dedicated &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/features/trust-center/">SBOM hub and Trust Center&lt;/a> that provides controlled access to current and historical SBOMs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="practical-implications-for-manufacturers">Practical Implications for Manufacturers&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re preparing a premarket submission (510(k), PMA, De Novo), here&amp;rsquo;s what the FDA expects in practice:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="sbom-compliance-checklist">SBOM Compliance Checklist&lt;/h3>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>NTIA Minimum Elements&lt;/strong> — Ensure your SBOM includes all required fields (supplier, component name, version, unique identifier, dependencies, author, timestamp)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Machine-readable format&lt;/strong> — Use SPDX or CycloneDX&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Inventory completeness&lt;/strong> — Cover all software elements in your device&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Support and lifecycle metadata&lt;/strong> — Document support status and EOL dates for each component&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Known vulnerability assessment&lt;/strong> — Tie vulnerabilities back to risk controls&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Traceability and architecture linkage&lt;/strong> — Connect SBOMs to documentation and risk models&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ongoing maintenance strategy&lt;/strong> — Plan for SBOM updates through the device&amp;rsquo;s life&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="consequences-of-non-compliance">Consequences of Non-Compliance&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Noncompliance or insufficient SBOM information can result in:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Refuse-to-accept decisions&lt;/strong> at the submission stage&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Delays in review&lt;/strong> requiring resubmission with complete SBOM and analysis&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The message is clear: get your SBOM documentation right the first time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-sbomify-helps-with-fda-compliance">How sbomify Helps with FDA Compliance&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Medical devices often have long lifecycles — sometimes 10-15 years or more. Managing SBOMs across that timespan, through multiple software updates and component changes, requires purpose-built tooling that automates the entire &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/features/generate-collaborate-analyze/">SBOM lifecycle&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The FDA&amp;rsquo;s June 2025 cybersecurity guidance makes it clear: SBOMs are no longer optional for medical device manufacturers. They&amp;rsquo;re a critical component of premarket submissions and ongoing compliance. The guidance sets clear expectations for SBOM content, format, and lifecycle management — and the FDA is prepared to refuse submissions that don&amp;rsquo;t meet these standards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Getting ahead of these requirements isn&amp;rsquo;t just about regulatory compliance — it&amp;rsquo;s about building more secure devices and maintaining trust with healthcare providers and patients.&lt;/p>

To break down what this means in practice, Viktor sat down with Sarah Fluchs on the Nerding Out with Viktor podcast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sarah isn&amp;rsquo;t just any commentator on the CRA - she serves on the &lt;strong>EU Commission&amp;rsquo;s CRA expert group&lt;/strong>, giving her first-hand involvement in shaping this landmark regulation. With a PhD in security-by-design and years of experience in OT (Operational Technology) cybersecurity, she brings a rare blend of technical depth and policy insight.&lt;/p>

&lt;/script>
&lt;h2 id="sboms-are-non-negotiable-for-cra-compliance">SBOMs Are Non-Negotiable for CRA Compliance&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Sarah is emphatic: &lt;strong>SBOMs are critical for CRA compliance&lt;/strong>. The regulation requires manufacturers to maintain full visibility into their software supply chain, and SBOMs are the mechanism to achieve this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But generating quality SBOMs is only half the battle. The real challenge lies in managing them over time - tracking versions, maintaining audit trails, and making software components traceable across complex supply chains. For manufacturers of long-lifecycle hardware, this represents a fundamental operational shift.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is exactly where proper tooling becomes essential. A platform like &lt;a href="">sbomify&lt;/a> addresses these challenges by providing:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Lifecycle management&lt;/strong> - Archive and track SBOMs across product versions and releases&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Centralized portal&lt;/strong> - Manage all your security artifacts in one place, with full version history&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Trust Center&lt;/strong> - Share SBOMs with stakeholders (customers, auditors, regulators) through a branded portal&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>CI/CD integration&lt;/strong> - Generate SBOMs automatically in your pipeline and upload them to sbomify&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="the-5-year-support-requirement-changes-everything">The 5-Year Support Requirement Changes Everything&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The CRA mandates security updates for the expected product lifetime, with a &lt;strong>minimum of five years&lt;/strong>. For OT devices that often operate for 20+ years, this forces companies to fundamentally rethink their approach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This isn&amp;rsquo;t just about patching - it&amp;rsquo;s about maintaining comprehensive records of what software was shipped, when, and to whom. You need to be able to answer: &amp;ldquo;What components were in version 2.3.1 that we shipped in 2024?&amp;rdquo; years down the line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is where SBOM archiving becomes critical. With sbomify, every release is captured and stored, creating an auditable trail that satisfies CRA&amp;rsquo;s documentation requirements without manual tracking.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="vulnerability-management-at-scale">Vulnerability Management at Scale&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Manufacturers must establish robust vulnerability handling processes, including responsible disclosure mechanisms. Sarah notes that the hardest part isn&amp;rsquo;t formal reporting - it&amp;rsquo;s building an efficient system to triage the influx of vulnerability reports.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>sbomify integrates with vulnerability databases like &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/features/integrations/">Google OSV&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/features/integrations/">Dependency Track&lt;/a>, allowing you to continuously monitor your archived SBOMs for newly discovered vulnerabilities - even for products shipped years ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="sarahs-key-message">Sarah&amp;rsquo;s Key Message&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;CRA compliance isn&amp;rsquo;t about ticking boxes. Done right, it&amp;rsquo;s a path to stronger engineering practices, deeper supply chain accountability, and better product security.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Her advice for manufacturers getting started:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Find your showstoppers early&lt;/strong> - Run your products through the CRA requirements now to identify major blockers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Start your risk assessment&lt;/strong> - This is the linchpin that informs all other decisions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Establish vulnerability handling&lt;/strong> - Build the processes to manage the influx of security information&lt;/li>

A software supply chain encompasses everything that contributes to a finished application: open source libraries, third-party services, build tools, package registries, CI/CD pipelines, and the people and processes that connect them. Managing this chain is essential because a vulnerability or compromise at any point can propagate downstream to every consumer of the software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://sbomify.com/assets/images/d2/supply-chain-risk.svg" alt="Software supply chain from upstream dependencies through build to downstream consumers">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-a-software-supply-chain">What Is a Software Supply Chain?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A software supply chain is the complete set of components, dependencies, tools, and workflows involved in creating, building, and distributing a piece of software. Just as a physical supply chain traces the path of raw materials through manufacturing to a finished product, a software supply chain traces the path of code from its origins to its deployment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Modern applications are overwhelmingly assembled rather than written from scratch. Studies consistently show that &lt;a href="https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/estimating-total-number-linux-contributors-approach-using-linus-law/">70-90% of a typical application consists of open source components&lt;/a> drawn from public package registries like npm, PyPI, Maven Central, and crates.io. Each of these components has its own dependencies, creating a deep tree of transitive dependencies that most development teams never manually audit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This reality makes software supply chain risk management (SSCRM) a critical discipline. If a single component in your dependency tree is compromised, vulnerable, or abandoned, the risk flows directly into your application and to your users.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="chain-of-custody-in-software">Chain of Custody in Software&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Chain of custody is a concept borrowed from forensics and physical supply chains. In the software context, chain of custody refers to the documented trail that records who created, modified, built, and distributed each component in a software product. A robust chain of custody answers questions like:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Where did this component originate?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Who authored and maintained it?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Was it modified between the source repository and the package registry?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Was the build process reproducible and tamper-evident?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/what-is-sbom/">Software Bills of Materials&lt;/a> (SBOMs) provide the component-level inventory that underpins chain of custody. Frameworks like &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2024/08/17/what-is-slsa/">SLSA&lt;/a> (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts) and &lt;a href="https://in-toto.io/">in-toto&lt;/a> add attestation layers that cryptographically verify each step in the build process.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="major-software-supply-chain-attacks">Major Software Supply Chain Attacks&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Several high-profile incidents have demonstrated the consequences of supply chain compromise.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="solarwinds-2020">SolarWinds (2020)&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Attackers compromised the build system of SolarWinds&amp;rsquo; Orion IT monitoring platform, injecting malicious code into a routine software update. Approximately 18,000 organizations, including U.S. government agencies, installed the compromised update. The attack was attributed to a state-sponsored actor and went undetected for months. It demonstrated that compromising a single widely-used vendor can provide access to thousands of downstream organizations.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="log4shell-2021">Log4Shell (2021)&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228">CVE-2021-44228&lt;/a>, known as Log4Shell, was a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Apache Log4j, a ubiquitous Java logging library. The vulnerability affected millions of applications worldwide. Organizations without component inventories struggled for weeks to determine whether they were affected. This incident became the single most cited argument for SBOM adoption: organizations with SBOMs could identify affected systems in minutes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="xz-utils-backdoor-2024">XZ Utils Backdoor (2024)&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3094">CVE-2024-3094&lt;/a> revealed a deliberately planted backdoor in the XZ Utils compression library, a component present in virtually every Linux distribution. A malicious contributor spent years building trust in the project before inserting the backdoor. This attack showed that supply chain risks include not just accidental vulnerabilities but intentional sabotage through social engineering of open source maintainers.&lt;/p>

&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;h2 id="software-supply-chain-risk-management-frameworks">Software Supply Chain Risk Management Frameworks&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Several frameworks provide structured approaches to managing software supply chain risk.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="nist-c-scrm-sp-800-161-rev-1">NIST C-SCRM (SP 800-161 Rev 1)&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/161/r1/final">NIST SP 800-161 Rev 1&lt;/a> (&amp;ldquo;Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Systems and Organizations&amp;rdquo;) provides the most comprehensive federal guidance on supply chain risk. It builds on the &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/nist-800-53/">NIST SP 800-53&lt;/a> control framework, particularly the SR (Supply Chain Risk Management) family, and provides detailed practices for identifying, assessing, and mitigating supply chain risks throughout the system development life cycle.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="executive-order-14028">Executive Order 14028&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/eo-14028/">Executive Order 14028&lt;/a> (&amp;ldquo;Improving the Nation&amp;rsquo;s Cybersecurity&amp;rdquo;, 2021) directed federal agencies to enhance software supply chain security, including requiring SBOMs from software vendors and establishing the &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/ntia-minimum-elements/">NTIA minimum elements&lt;/a> for SBOM content.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="eu-cyber-resilience-act">EU Cyber Resilience Act&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/eu-cra/">EU Cyber Resilience Act&lt;/a> (CRA) requires manufacturers of products with digital elements to identify and document vulnerabilities and components, including providing SBOMs. The CRA makes software supply chain transparency a legal obligation for products sold in the EU market.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="slsa-framework">SLSA Framework&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://slsa.dev/">SLSA&lt;/a> (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts) is a framework from the &lt;a href="https://openssf.org/">OpenSSF&lt;/a> that defines three levels of build security maturity in the current &lt;a href="https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/levels">v1.0 specification&lt;/a>. Each level adds protections: from documenting build provenance (Level 1) through using a hosted build platform (Level 2) to hardened, tamper-resistant builds (Level 3).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-sboms-support-supply-chain-management">How SBOMs Support Supply Chain Management&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>An &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/what-is-sbom/">SBOM&lt;/a> is the foundational tool for software supply chain visibility. Without knowing what components are in your software, you cannot assess supply chain risk. SBOMs support supply chain management in several ways:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Component visibility.&lt;/strong> SBOMs provide a complete inventory of every library, framework, and module in your application, including transitive dependencies that developers may not be aware of.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Vulnerability identification.&lt;/strong> Once you have an SBOM, platforms like &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://dependencytrack.org/">OWASP Dependency-Track&lt;/a> can continuously match your components against vulnerability databases like the &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/">NVD&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">CISA KEV catalog&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>License compliance.&lt;/strong> SBOMs document the license of each component, enabling automated detection of copyleft or restrictive licenses that may create legal obligations. See our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/22/gpl-license-guide/">GPL license guide&lt;/a> for details on copyleft compliance.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Incident response.&lt;/strong> When a new vulnerability is disclosed, SBOMs allow you to immediately determine which of your products are affected, drastically reducing response time.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Regulatory compliance.&lt;/strong> Multiple frameworks now require or strongly recommend SBOMs, including &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/eo-14028/">EO 14028&lt;/a>, the &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/eu-cra/">EU CRA&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/fda-medical-device/">FDA medical device guidance&lt;/a>. See our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/">compliance guide&lt;/a> for a complete comparison.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>To start generating SBOMs for your projects, see our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/guides/">language-specific SBOM guides&lt;/a> covering Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, Rust, and more.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="best-practices-for-software-supply-chain-security">Best Practices for Software Supply Chain Security&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Generate and maintain SBOMs.&lt;/strong> Automate SBOM generation in your CI/CD pipeline using tools like the &lt;a href="https://github.com/sbomify/github-action/">sbomify GitHub Action&lt;/a>. Keep SBOMs current with every release.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Monitor dependencies continuously.&lt;/strong> Do not rely on point-in-time audits. Use SBOM-based monitoring to catch newly disclosed vulnerabilities in your deployed components.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Verify component provenance.&lt;/strong> Use signed packages, verify checksums, and adopt frameworks like SLSA to ensure components have not been tampered with between source and deployment.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Minimize your dependency footprint.&lt;/strong> Fewer dependencies mean a smaller attack surface. Regularly review and remove unused dependencies. Prefer well-maintained libraries with active security response processes.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Pin and lock dependencies.&lt;/strong> Use lock files to ensure reproducible builds and prevent unexpected dependency updates. Review dependency changes before merging.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Establish a vulnerability response process.&lt;/strong> Define SLAs for patching based on severity and exploitability. Monitor the &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">CISA KEV catalog&lt;/a> for actively exploited vulnerabilities in your stack.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Evaluate suppliers.&lt;/strong> For critical commercial dependencies, assess the vendor&amp;rsquo;s security practices, including whether they provide SBOMs and maintain vulnerability disclosure processes.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-software-supply-chain-management">What is software supply chain management?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Software supply chain management is the practice of identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks across the full chain of components, tools, and processes used to build and deliver software. It encompasses open source dependency management, build pipeline security, vendor assessment, and ongoing vulnerability monitoring. The goal is to ensure that every component in your software is known, trusted, and up to date.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-a-chain-of-custody-in-software">What is a chain of custody in software?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Chain of custody in the software context refers to the documented, verifiable record of who created, modified, built, and distributed each component in a software product. It establishes trust by providing evidence that a component has not been tampered with between its source and its deployment. SBOMs, build attestations (like SLSA provenance), and code signing are the primary tools for establishing software chain of custody.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-do-sboms-help-with-supply-chain-security">How do SBOMs help with supply chain security?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>SBOMs provide the component-level visibility that is the foundation of supply chain security. Without knowing what is in your software, you cannot assess risk, identify vulnerabilities, or respond to incidents. SBOMs enable automated vulnerability scanning, license compliance checking, and rapid incident response when new vulnerabilities like Log4Shell are disclosed. They are required or recommended by most major compliance frameworks.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-the-nist-risk-management-framework-for-supply-chains">What is the NIST risk management framework for supply chains?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>NIST publishes several frameworks relevant to supply chain risk management. &lt;a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/161/r1/final">NIST SP 800-161 Rev 1&lt;/a> is the primary guidance for cybersecurity supply chain risk management (C-SCRM). &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/nist-800-53/">NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5&lt;/a> includes the SR (Supply Chain Risk Management) control family with specific controls for provenance (SR-4) and supply chain processes (SR-3). These frameworks are increasingly referenced in procurement requirements and compliance obligations.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-are-the-biggest-software-supply-chain-risks">What are the biggest software supply chain risks?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The most significant risks include: vulnerable open source dependencies (the most common attack surface), compromised build systems (as in SolarWinds), malicious packages in public registries (typosquatting and dependency confusion), and social engineering of open source maintainers (as in XZ Utils). Transitive dependencies, which are pulled in indirectly and often unreviewed, represent a particularly underestimated risk.&lt;/p></description><category>education</category></item><item><title>Major Updates: sbomify v0.21 and Action Module v0.8 &amp;amp; v0.9</title><link>https://sbomify.com/2025/12/19/major-updates-sbomify-v0-21-and-action-modules/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sbomify.com/2025/12/19/major-updates-sbomify-v0-21-and-action-modules/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://sbomify.com/assets/images/sbomify-v0-21-release.png" alt="Major Updates">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have been busy at sbomify! Today we are announcing a triple release covering significant updates to both the core platform and our GitHub Action module. Here is a breakdown of what&amp;rsquo;s new.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="sbomify-v021-the-one-where-we-almost-ditched-vue">sbomify v0.21: &amp;ldquo;The One Where We Almost Ditched Vue&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This release brings substantial improvements to the user interface and underlying technology stack. As the release name suggests, we&amp;rsquo;ve undertaken a significant refactoring effort to streamline our frontend architecture.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="key-features">Key Features&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Vulnerability Trends Dashboard:&lt;/strong> A new interactive dashboard to visualize vulnerability trends over time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Enhanced Workspace Management:&lt;/strong> A new workspace switcher with a modal interface in the sidebar makes managing multiple environments easier than ever.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Custom Keycloak Login:&lt;/strong> We&amp;rsquo;ve introduced a custom Keycloak login theme with Tailwind CSS styling for a more seamless authentication experience.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improved Navigation:&lt;/strong> A new navbar search, improved notifications, and version display in the footer.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Under the hood, we migrated the Documents and SBOMs tables from Vue.js to &lt;strong>HTMX and Alpine.js&lt;/strong>, resulting in a lighter and more responsive interface. We also cleaned up the codebase by removing deprecated Vue.js components.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/sbomify/sbomify/releases/tag/v0.21">Read the full v0.21 release notes&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="sbomify-action-v09-the-one-where-generation-gets-modular">sbomify-action v0.9: &amp;ldquo;The One Where Generation Gets Modular&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Our GitHub Action module has received a major architectural upgrade focused on modularity and extensibility.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="modular-generation">Modular Generation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Version 0.9 introduces a &lt;strong>plugin architecture for SBOM generation&lt;/strong>. This system uses priority-based selection with automatic fallback (e.g., trying &lt;code>cyclonedx-py&lt;/code> first, then &lt;code>Trivy&lt;/code>, then &lt;code>Syft&lt;/code>), ensuring you get the best possible SBOM for your project type without manual configuration.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="ubuntu-apt-enrichment">Ubuntu APT Enrichment&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve added native metadata source support for &lt;code>pkg:deb/ubuntu/*&lt;/code> packages, covering LTS versions from 18.04 to 24.04 and 24.10.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="built-in-validation">Built-in Validation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Generated SBOMs are now automatically validated against the JSON Schema to ensure strict compliance.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="sbomify-action-v08-the-one-with-enrichment-plugins">sbomify-action v0.8: &amp;ldquo;The One With Enrichment Plugins&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Just prior to v0.9, we released v0.8, which completely rewrote the SBOM enrichment system.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="plugin-based-enrichment">Plugin-based Enrichment&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Similar to generation, enrichment is now plugin-based. We prioritize multiple data sources to maximize NTIA compliance. We have implemented 8 data sources including &lt;strong>PyPI, Debian, deps.dev, ecosyste.ms, PURL, ClearlyDefined, Repology, and RPM Repo&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Crucially, &lt;strong>lockfile components are now enriched&lt;/strong> rather than removed, preserving the integrity of your dependency graph while adding valuable metadata.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="expanded-ecosystem-support">Expanded Ecosystem Support&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>RPM Repository Enrichment:&lt;/strong> Native Tier 1 enrichment for RHEL-compatible distros (Rocky, Alma, CentOS Stream, Fedora, Amazon Linux).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Dart/Flutter:&lt;/strong> Added support for Dart packages via pub.dev and &lt;code>pubspec.lock&lt;/code> enrichment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>CycloneDX 1.7:&lt;/strong> Full support for the latest CycloneDX 1.7 schema.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These updates represent a significant step forward in making sbomify the most flexible and compliant SBOM management platform.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Check out the updated &lt;a href="https://github.com/sbomify/github-action">sbomify-action repository&lt;/a> to get started with these new features!&lt;/p></description><category>announcement</category></item><item><title>CVE Vulnerabilities Explained: What They Are and Why They Matter</title><link>https://sbomify.com/2025/12/18/cve-vulnerability-explained/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sbomify.com/2025/12/18/cve-vulnerability-explained/</guid><description>&lt;p>A CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) is a standardized identifier assigned to a publicly known cybersecurity vulnerability. Each CVE entry provides a unique ID, a description, and references to related advisories, giving security teams a common language for tracking and discussing specific flaws. The CVE system is maintained by the &lt;a href="https://www.cve.org/">MITRE Corporation&lt;/a> and serves as the backbone of modern vulnerability management across the software industry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://sbomify.com/assets/images/d2/cve-lifecycle.svg" alt="CVE lifecycle from discovery through remediation">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-a-cve">What Is a CVE?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>CVE stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. It is a dictionary of publicly disclosed security flaws, each assigned a unique identifier in the format &lt;code>CVE-YEAR-NUMBER&lt;/code> (for example, &lt;code>CVE-2021-44228&lt;/code> for the Log4Shell vulnerability). The CVE system does not rate the severity of vulnerabilities — it simply catalogs them with a standardized reference that anyone in the cybersecurity community can use unambiguously.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The program was launched in 1999 by MITRE Corporation with funding from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/">CISA&lt;/a>). Before CVE existed, different vendors and databases used their own naming schemes for the same vulnerability, leading to confusion and duplicated effort. CVE solved this by providing a single, authoritative numbering system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As of early 2026, the CVE database contains over 330,000 entries and continues to grow rapidly — over 48,000 CVEs were published in 2025 alone. The MITRE CVE program relies on a network of CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs) — organizations authorized to assign CVE IDs within their scope. Major CNAs include Microsoft, Google, Red Hat, Apache, and hundreds of other vendors and open source projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-the-cve-process-works">How the CVE Process Works&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="discovery-and-assignment">Discovery and Assignment&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When a vulnerability is discovered — by a security researcher, vendor, or automated tool — it can be reported to the relevant CNA or directly to MITRE. The CNA evaluates the report and, if it meets the criteria (a security flaw in publicly available software that can be independently fixed), assigns a CVE ID.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="publication">Publication&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Once assigned, the CVE entry is published to the &lt;a href="https://www.cve.org/">CVE List&lt;/a> with a description and references. The entry may initially be marked as &amp;ldquo;reserved&amp;rdquo; while the vendor works on a patch, then updated with full details upon coordinated public disclosure.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="enrichment">Enrichment&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>After publication, the &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/">National Vulnerability Database&lt;/a> (NVD), maintained by NIST, enriches the CVE with additional data: severity scores (via CVSS), affected product configurations (CPE data), and references to patches and advisories. This enrichment makes CVE data actionable for vulnerability management tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cve-vs-cvss-vs-kev-understanding-the-differences">CVE vs. CVSS vs. KEV: Understanding the Differences&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>These three acronyms are related but distinct. Confusing them is common, so here is a clear breakdown.&lt;/p>

&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>A CVE tells you &lt;em>what&lt;/em> the vulnerability is. A &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/02/05/what-is-cvss-vulnerability-scoring/">CVSS&lt;/a> score tells you &lt;em>how bad&lt;/em> it is. A &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/30/what-is-kev-cisa-known-exploited-vulnerabilities/">KEV&lt;/a> listing tells you &lt;em>it is being actively exploited right now&lt;/em>. Effective vulnerability management uses all three signals together.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-national-vulnerability-database-nvd">The National Vulnerability Database (NVD)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/">National Vulnerability Database&lt;/a> is the U.S. government&amp;rsquo;s repository of standards-based vulnerability management data. NVD builds on the CVE list by adding:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>CVSS scores&lt;/strong> — severity ratings using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>CPE data&lt;/strong> — Common Platform Enumeration entries that map vulnerabilities to specific products and versions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>CWE classifications&lt;/strong> — Common Weakness Enumeration categories describing the type of flaw (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Fix references&lt;/strong> — links to vendor advisories and patches&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>NVD is freely accessible and is the primary data source for most vulnerability scanning tools. When a platform like &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/anchore/grype">Grype&lt;/a>, or &lt;a href="https://dependencytrack.org/">OWASP Dependency-Track&lt;/a> scans your software for known issues, it is typically checking component versions against NVD data.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cve-funding-and-governance">CVE Funding and Governance&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The CVE program has historically been funded through U.S. government contracts administered by CISA and DHS. In 2025, questions about the sustainability of MITRE&amp;rsquo;s CVE funding drew significant attention from the cybersecurity community. The concern was straightforward: the entire global vulnerability tracking ecosystem depends on a single program funded by a single government.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In response, the &lt;a href="https://www.cve.org/">CVE Foundation&lt;/a> was established to diversify funding and governance. The CVE Board, an international group of cybersecurity experts, provides strategic oversight. The expansion of the CNA network — now numbering over 400 organizations across 40+ countries — has also distributed the operational workload beyond MITRE alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Regardless of governance structure, the CVE system remains the de facto global standard for vulnerability identification.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="vulnerability-management-with-cves">Vulnerability Management with CVEs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Vulnerability management is the continuous process of identifying, evaluating, prioritizing, and remediating security flaws in software. CVEs are the fundamental building blocks of this process.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-vulnerability-management-lifecycle">The Vulnerability Management Lifecycle&lt;/h3>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Discover&lt;/strong> — Inventory all software components in your environment (this is where SBOMs are critical)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Identify&lt;/strong> — Match your components against known CVEs using vulnerability scanners&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Evaluate&lt;/strong> — Assess severity using CVSS scores, exploit availability (KEV status), and your own risk context&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Prioritize&lt;/strong> — Not all CVEs require immediate action. Focus on high-severity vulnerabilities in internet-facing or critical systems, especially those listed in the &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">CISA KEV catalog&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Remediate&lt;/strong> — Apply patches, update dependencies, or implement mitigations&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Verify&lt;/strong> — Confirm the fix was applied and re-scan to ensure the vulnerability is resolved&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="vulnerability-scanners-and-scanning-tools">Vulnerability Scanners and Scanning Tools&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Several categories of tools support CVE-based vulnerability management:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/11/software-composition-analysis-sca/">Software Composition Analysis (SCA)&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> tools scan open source dependencies for known CVEs. Examples include &lt;a href="https://github.com/anchore/grype">Grype&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://snyk.io/">Snyk&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy">Trivy&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Container scanners&lt;/strong> analyze Docker and OCI images for vulnerable packages. See our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/guides/docker/">Docker SBOM guide&lt;/a> for details.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Network vulnerability scanners&lt;/strong> probe running systems for known flaws.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/02/01/sbom-scanning-vulnerability-detection/">SBOM-based analysis&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> platforms like &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://dependencytrack.org/">OWASP Dependency-Track&lt;/a> ingest SBOMs and continuously monitor components against new CVE disclosures.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>See our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/resources/">resources page&lt;/a> for a complete list of vulnerability scanning and SBOM analysis tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The key advantage of SBOM-based scanning is that it decouples vulnerability identification from the build process. Once you have an SBOM, you can re-scan it at any time as new CVEs are published — without needing access to the source code or build system.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-sboms-enable-rapid-cve-response">How SBOMs Enable Rapid CVE Response&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The value of a &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/what-is-sbom/">Software Bill of Materials&lt;/a> becomes most obvious during a vulnerability incident. Consider the Log4Shell scenario (CVE-2021-44228, disclosed December 2021):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Without SBOMs:&lt;/strong> Teams had to manually audit every application, check dependency files, search through build systems, and contact vendors to determine if they were using Apache Log4j. This took many organizations days or weeks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>With SBOMs:&lt;/strong> A simple search across your SBOM repository for &lt;code>org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core&lt;/code> returned a complete list of affected applications in minutes.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This is why compliance frameworks increasingly mandate SBOMs. The &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/eu-cra/">EU Cyber Resilience Act&lt;/a> requires manufacturers to identify and document components in their products. &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/eo-14028/">Executive Order 14028&lt;/a> requires software vendors to the U.S. government to provide SBOMs. The &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/cisa-minimum-elements/">CISA minimum elements&lt;/a> specify that SBOMs should include unique identifiers (such as &lt;a href="https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec">Package URL&lt;/a>) that can be matched against CVE-affected component data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To start generating SBOMs for your projects, see our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/guides/">language-specific SBOM guides&lt;/a> covering Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, Rust, and more.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="notable-cves-that-changed-the-industry">Notable CVEs That Changed the Industry&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Several high-profile CVEs have shaped how the industry approaches vulnerability management:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>CVE-2014-0160 (Heartbleed)&lt;/strong> — A critical flaw in OpenSSL that exposed encrypted communications for millions of servers. Highlighted the risk of widely shared dependencies.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>CVE-2017-5638 (Apache Struts)&lt;/strong> — The vulnerability behind the Equifax breach, which exposed personal data of 147 million people. Demonstrated the consequences of slow patching.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell)&lt;/strong> — A remote code execution flaw in Apache Log4j that affected millions of applications. Became the catalyst for widespread SBOM adoption as organizations struggled to identify affected systems.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>CVE-2024-3094 (XZ Utils)&lt;/strong> — A supply chain attack where a malicious contributor inserted a backdoor into the XZ compression library. Showed that vulnerabilities can be deliberately introduced, not just accidentally created.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Each of these incidents reinforced the same lesson: you cannot protect what you cannot see. SBOMs provide that visibility.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="best-practices-for-cve-management">Best Practices for CVE Management&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Maintain SBOMs for all your software.&lt;/strong> An accurate component inventory is the foundation of effective vulnerability management. Use automated tools to &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/guides/">generate SBOMs&lt;/a> as part of your CI/CD pipeline.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Automate vulnerability scanning.&lt;/strong> Integrate SBOM-based scanning tools into your build and deployment process. Continuous monitoring catches newly disclosed CVEs without manual effort.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Use multiple severity signals.&lt;/strong> Do not rely on CVSS scores alone. Factor in KEV status (is it being exploited?), your deployment context (is the component exposed?), and exploit maturity.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Establish a patching SLA.&lt;/strong> Define response timeframes based on severity. Critical CVEs in exposed systems should be addressed within days, not months.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Subscribe to advisories.&lt;/strong> Monitor the &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds">NVD data feeds&lt;/a>, vendor security bulletins, and the &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">CISA KEV catalog&lt;/a> for timely notification of new CVEs affecting your stack.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Document your response process.&lt;/strong> When the next Log4Shell-scale event happens, you need a practiced runbook — not a scramble. SBOMs, pre-defined escalation paths, and automated alerting make the difference.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="what-does-cve-stand-for">What does CVE stand for?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>CVE stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. It is a system for assigning unique identifiers to publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Each CVE ID (e.g., CVE-2021-44228) serves as a standard reference that security teams, vendors, and tools can use to unambiguously identify a specific flaw.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-a-cve-and-a-vulnerability">What is the difference between a CVE and a vulnerability?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A vulnerability is any security weakness in software that could be exploited. A CVE is the standardized identifier assigned to a publicly known vulnerability. Not all vulnerabilities have CVE IDs — only those that are publicly disclosed and meet the CVE program&amp;rsquo;s inclusion criteria receive a CVE number. Think of CVE as the naming system, and vulnerability as the broader concept.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="who-assigns-cve-numbers">Who assigns CVE numbers?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>CVE IDs are assigned by CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs). MITRE Corporation serves as the primary CNA and coordinates the overall program. Over 400 organizations, including major software vendors like Microsoft, Google, and Red Hat, are authorized to assign CVE IDs within their product scope. Researchers can also request CVE IDs through the &lt;a href="https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/ReportRequest">CVE Request form&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-are-cves-used-in-vulnerability-management">How are CVEs used in vulnerability management?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>CVEs are the foundation of vulnerability management. Organizations use vulnerability scanners and Software Composition Analysis tools to match their software components against known CVEs. When a match is found, the CVSS severity score and KEV status help prioritize remediation. SBOMs make this process more efficient by providing a complete component inventory that can be continuously rescanned.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-the-national-vulnerability-database-nvd">What is the National Vulnerability Database (NVD)?&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re excited to announce the release of &lt;strong>sbomify v0.20&lt;/strong>, a significant update focused on empowering organizations to make their Trust Center truly their own. This release introduces custom domain support, a redesigned onboarding experience, and numerous improvements to workspace management and security.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="custom-domain-support">Custom Domain Support&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The headline feature of v0.20 is &lt;strong>custom domain support for public Trust Center pages&lt;/strong>. Workspaces can now use their own domain (via CNAME) to serve their public Trust Center, making it seamlessly integrate with their existing web presence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With this update, you can:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Configure a custom domain directly from your workspace branding settings&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use clean, slug-based URLs when accessing via your custom domain&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Benefit from extended caching with proper invalidation when your content changes&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This feature is perfect for organizations that want their Trust Center to live at something like &lt;code>trust.yourcompany.com&lt;/code> rather than a subdomain of sbomify.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="redesigned-onboarding-wizard">Redesigned Onboarding Wizard&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve completely reimagined the onboarding experience for new users. The previous multi-step wizard has been simplified into a &lt;strong>single-step SBOM identity setup&lt;/strong> that gets you up and running faster.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Key improvements include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Automatic redirect for first-time users to set up their SBOM identity&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Plan-aware getting started flow that adapts to your subscription&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Modernized UI with better handling of edge cases&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="workspace-management-enhancements">Workspace Management Enhancements&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Managing your workspace just got easier with several quality-of-life improvements:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Workspace name editing&lt;/strong>: Change your workspace name directly from settings&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>User invitation management&lt;/strong>: Manage pending invitations from the settings page&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improved session management&lt;/strong>: Better caching and workspace switching with proper cache invalidation&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="team-invitation-system-improvements">Team Invitation System Improvements&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve overhauled how team invitations work with a new &lt;strong>token-based invitation system&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>More secure invitation URLs backed by database tokens&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Persistent team settings with toast notifications for invitation status&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Improved handling and styling throughout the invitation flow&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="public-pages-improvements">Public Pages Improvements&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Your public Trust Center pages now offer an even better experience:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Breadcrumb navigation&lt;/strong> for easier navigation on component pages&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Copy-to-clipboard functionality&lt;/strong> for quick sharing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fixed layout and logo display issues&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Consistent &amp;ldquo;Trust Center&amp;rdquo; capitalization across all templates&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="security-hardening">Security Hardening&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This release includes important security improvements:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Fixed incomplete URL substring sanitization (addressing CodeQL alerts)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added admin permission restrictions for removing team owners&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Improved workspace member removal and session handling&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Added comprehensive tests for edge cases with pending invitations&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="infrastructure-updates">Infrastructure Updates&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Under the hood, we&amp;rsquo;ve made several infrastructure improvements:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Improved HTTPS/TLS handling with Caddy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Configurable port exposure in Docker setup&lt;/li>
&lt;li>New &lt;code>bin/deploy.sh&lt;/code> deployment script&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Updated deployment documentation&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="by-the-numbers">By the Numbers&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This release involved significant effort across the codebase:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>125 files changed&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>~9,663 lines added&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>~1,611 lines removed&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re self-hosting sbomify, update to v0.20 to take advantage of these new features. For users on our hosted platform, these improvements are already live.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2024/11/18/c-conundrum/">The C conundrum&lt;/a> as there&amp;rsquo;s so
much C code that needs SBOMs, but there was no straightforward way to
generate them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://conan.io/">Conan&lt;/a> got a mention, but at the time wasn&amp;rsquo;t working as
hoped.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thankfully things have improved since then, which means that Conan provides
a viable route to generating SBOMs for C (and C++) projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most crucial change is that SBOM generation tools like Aqua&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href="https://trivy.dev/">Trivy&lt;/a> can now generate reasonable output from Conan lock
files. That in turn means that sbomify can use a &lt;code>conan.lock&lt;/code> file in the same
way it would use a lock file for any other package manager.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Conan &lt;a href="https://docs.conan.io/2/">documentation&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://academy.jfrog.com/conan-2-essentials">tutorial&lt;/a> have improved
dramatically, which makes it much easier to get started.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s relatively straightforward to &amp;lsquo;bolt on&amp;rsquo; a &lt;code>conanfile.py&lt;/code> to a project and
use it to describe dependencies. A &lt;code>conan.lock&lt;/code> can then be generated and
used as the basis of an SBOM. The only problem is that any changes to the
project dependencies need to be (manually) updated in the Conan file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A more integrated approach means going all in on Conan, and using it to
generate configuration and build descriptions like &lt;code>CMakeLists.txt&lt;/code>.
Conan is very capable and flexible, and an easy win for a green field project.
But the 6.5 billion lines of open source C out there are testament to a huge
brown field problem. There&amp;rsquo;s been huge investment in the existing config and
build systems for those projects, encapsulated in CMake, GNU Autotools, and
many other systems. Refactoring those projects into Conan will require deep
understanding of the existing tool chain, and how Conan generates builds.
We might wish for an AI magic wand to make the transition easy, but it seems
to be a task that&amp;rsquo;s beyond the present generation of coding assistants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As regulatory pressure from the EU Cyber Resilience Act
(&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_Resilience_Act">CRA&lt;/a>) and other mandates
mounts there&amp;rsquo;s going to be increasing interest in getting SBOMs for C stuff.
Conan can be used as a &amp;lsquo;bolt on&amp;rsquo; workaround, and with increased adoption
and familiarity may become the de facto way of doing things. At least for
everything that lies outside of other package ecosystems like Yocto and
Zephyr.&lt;/p>
