In cybersecurity, SBOMs answer the question that every security team must be able to answer: &lt;em>what is in our software?&lt;/em> Without this visibility, vulnerability management, incident response, and compliance are all reactive at best and impossible at worst.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-sboms-matter-for-cybersecurity">Why SBOMs Matter for Cybersecurity&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Modern software is assembled from open source and third-party components. A typical application consists of &lt;a href="https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/estimating-total-number-linux-contributors-approach-using-linus-law/">70-90% open source code&lt;/a> drawn from package registries. Each component is a potential entry point for attackers — whether through known vulnerabilities, compromised packages, or abandoned libraries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SBOMs make the composition of software visible. This visibility is the prerequisite for every other cybersecurity activity involving third-party code: you cannot patch what you do not know you are running.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="sboms-and-vulnerability-management">SBOMs and Vulnerability Management&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Vulnerability management is the cybersecurity function that benefits most directly from SBOMs. The workflow connects component inventories to threat intelligence, creating a continuous monitoring capability.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-problem-without-sboms">The Problem Without SBOMs&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When a new &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/18/cve-vulnerability-explained/">CVE&lt;/a> is disclosed, organizations without SBOMs must:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Manually determine which components are used across all applications&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Check each application&amp;rsquo;s dependency files (if accessible)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Search container images, build artifacts, and deployment manifests&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Aggregate findings across teams and environments&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This manual process can take days or weeks. During that time, the vulnerability may be actively exploited.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-solution-with-sboms">The Solution With SBOMs&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>With SBOMs generated and ingested into a management platform like &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://dependencytrack.org/">OWASP Dependency-Track&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>New CVE is published to vulnerability databases&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Platform automatically matches the CVE to SBOM component inventories&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Affected products and versions are identified within seconds&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Alerts are sent to the responsible teams&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Remediation begins immediately&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This automated approach reduces the response window from days to minutes. The difference is especially critical for vulnerabilities listed in the &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/30/what-is-kev-cisa-known-exploited-vulnerabilities/">CISA KEV catalog&lt;/a> — those confirmed to be actively exploited in the wild.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="incident-response-the-log4shell-case-study">Incident Response: The Log4Shell Case Study&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Log4Shell vulnerability (&lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228">CVE-2021-44228&lt;/a>) in December 2021 is the defining example of why SBOMs matter for cybersecurity. Apache Log4j was a ubiquitous Java logging library used as both a direct and transitive &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/29/what-is-a-dependency-in-software/">dependency&lt;/a> in millions of applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Organizations with SBOMs&lt;/strong> queried their component inventories and identified affected systems within minutes. They knew exactly which applications used Log4j, at which versions, and in which environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Organizations without SBOMs&lt;/strong> spent weeks manually auditing codebases, scanning containers, and contacting vendors to determine exposure. Some discovered Log4j in applications they did not even know existed in their environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Log4Shell became the single most cited argument for SBOM adoption. It demonstrated that in a crisis, the ability to answer &amp;ldquo;which of our systems are affected?&amp;rdquo; is not optional — it is a core cybersecurity capability.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="sboms-and-the-compliance-landscape">SBOMs and the Compliance Landscape&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Multiple cybersecurity regulations and frameworks now require or strongly recommend SBOMs. This reflects the growing consensus that software transparency is essential for security.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>SBOMs support cybersecurity at every stage:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="prevention">Prevention&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Dependency auditing.&lt;/strong> SBOMs reveal the full dependency tree including &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/29/what-is-a-dependency-in-software/">transitive dependencies&lt;/a>, enabling teams to identify and replace risky components before deployment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>License compliance.&lt;/strong> SBOMs document the license of every component, preventing license conflicts that can create legal exposure. See our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/22/gpl-license-guide/">GPL&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/22/mit-license-guide/">MIT&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/07/apache-license-2-guide/">Apache 2.0&lt;/a> guides for license-specific details.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Policy enforcement.&lt;/strong> SBOM-based tools can block deployments that include components with known critical vulnerabilities or prohibited licenses.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="detection">Detection&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Continuous vulnerability monitoring.&lt;/strong> SBOMs ingested into platforms like OWASP Dependency-Track are continuously matched against the &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/">NVD&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://osv.dev/">OSV&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">CISA KEV catalog&lt;/a>.

&lt;h3 id="response">Response&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Rapid impact assessment.&lt;/strong> Query SBOM repositories to immediately identify which products and environments contain an affected component.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Targeted remediation.&lt;/strong> Knowing exactly where a vulnerable component is deployed enables precise patching rather than broad emergency measures.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>VEX communication.&lt;/strong> Use Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) documents to communicate whether a reported vulnerability actually affects your product.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="recovery">Recovery&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Audit trail.&lt;/strong> Retained SBOMs provide a historical record of what was deployed at any point in time, supporting post-incident analysis and regulatory reporting.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Rebuild verification.&lt;/strong> SBOMs document the components that should be present, enabling verification that rebuilt or patched software matches the intended composition.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you are beginning your SBOM journey:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Set up vulnerability monitoring.&lt;/strong> Use &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a> for integrated monitoring (built-in OSV and Dependency-Track scanning), or deploy a standalone &lt;a href="https://dependencytrack.org/">OWASP Dependency-Track&lt;/a> instance for continuous monitoring.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Establish a management process.&lt;/strong> Define how SBOMs are stored, versioned, and distributed. See our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/18/sbom-management-best-practices/">SBOM management guide&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="how-do-sboms-improve-cybersecurity">How do SBOMs improve cybersecurity?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>SBOMs improve cybersecurity by providing component-level visibility into software. This visibility enables automated vulnerability detection (matching components against CVE databases), rapid incident response (immediately identifying affected systems when a new vulnerability is disclosed), continuous compliance monitoring (tracking regulatory requirements), and informed risk management (understanding the full dependency chain and its associated risks).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="are-sboms-required-for-cybersecurity-compliance">Are SBOMs required for cybersecurity compliance?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>SBOMs are required or strongly recommended by multiple frameworks: U.S. Executive Order 14028 requires them for federal software procurement, the EU Cyber Resilience Act requires them for products with digital elements, FDA guidance requires them for medical device submissions, and NIST SP 800-53/800-171 include supply chain controls that SBOMs help satisfy. See our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/">compliance overview&lt;/a> for a framework-by-framework breakdown.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-did-log4shell-demonstrate-the-need-for-sboms">How did Log4Shell demonstrate the need for SBOMs?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When the Log4Shell vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) was disclosed in December 2021, organizations with SBOMs identified affected systems in minutes by querying their component inventories. Organizations without SBOMs spent weeks manually auditing codebases and scanning infrastructure. This stark contrast made Log4Shell the most commonly cited example of why SBOMs are essential for cybersecurity incident response.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-the-relationship-between-sboms-and-vulnerability-management">What is the relationship between SBOMs and vulnerability management?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>SBOMs provide the component inventory that vulnerability management depends on. Without knowing what components are in your software, you cannot determine which vulnerabilities affect you. SBOMs ingested into monitoring platforms are continuously matched against vulnerability databases, enabling automated detection and alerting. This transforms vulnerability management from a periodic manual exercise into a continuous automated process.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-do-i-start-using-sboms-for-cybersecurity">How do I start using SBOMs for cybersecurity?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Start by generating SBOMs for your applications using tools like Syft, Trivy, or language-specific generators. Automate generation in your CI/CD pipeline. Ingest SBOMs into a monitoring platform like OWASP Dependency-Track for continuous vulnerability scanning. Define remediation SLAs based on CVSS severity and KEV status. See our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/guides/">SBOM guides&lt;/a> for step-by-step instructions.&lt;/p></description><category>education</category></item><item><title>What Is CVSS? Understanding Vulnerability Severity Scoring</title><link>https://sbomify.com/2026/02/05/what-is-cvss-vulnerability-scoring/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sbomify.com/2026/02/05/what-is-cvss-vulnerability-scoring/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an open framework for communicating the severity of software vulnerabilities. Published and maintained by &lt;a href="https://www.first.org/cvss/">FIRST.org&lt;/a> (the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams), CVSS produces a numerical score from 0.0 to 10.0 that represents the severity of a vulnerability. The score is accompanied by a vector string that describes the specific characteristics used to calculate it. CVSS is the most widely used vulnerability scoring system in the world — the &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/">National Vulnerability Database&lt;/a> (NVD) publishes CVSS scores for virtually every &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/18/cve-vulnerability-explained/">CVE&lt;/a> entry.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-cvss-scores-work">How CVSS Scores Work&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A CVSS score is not a single number derived from one input. It is calculated from a set of metrics organized into metric groups. Each metric describes a specific characteristic of the vulnerability, and the combination produces the final score.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="cvss-v31-metric-groups">CVSS v3.1 Metric Groups&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>CVSS v3.1 (the most widely deployed version as of early 2026) defines three metric groups:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Base Score (0.0-10.0)&lt;/strong> — Represents the intrinsic qualities of the vulnerability that are constant over time and across environments. This is the score most commonly reported.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Attack Vector (AV):&lt;/strong> How the vulnerability is exploited — Network (remote), Adjacent (local network), Local (requires local access), or Physical (requires physical access)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Attack Complexity (AC):&lt;/strong> Whether specialized conditions must exist for exploitation — Low or High&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Privileges Required (PR):&lt;/strong> What level of privilege an attacker needs — None, Low, or High&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>User Interaction (UI):&lt;/strong> Whether a user must take action for exploitation — None or Required&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Scope (S):&lt;/strong> Whether exploitation impacts resources beyond the vulnerable component — Unchanged or Changed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Confidentiality Impact (C):&lt;/strong> Impact on data confidentiality — None, Low, or High&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Integrity Impact (I):&lt;/strong> Impact on data integrity — None, Low, or High&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Availability Impact (A):&lt;/strong> Impact on system availability — None, Low, or High&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Temporal Score&lt;/strong> — Adjusts the Base Score based on factors that change over time, such as whether an exploit is available, whether a patch exists, and confidence in the vulnerability report.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Environmental Score&lt;/strong> — Adjusts the score based on the specific environment where the vulnerability exists, allowing organizations to reflect their own infrastructure context.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="severity-ratings">Severity Ratings&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>CVSS scores map to qualitative severity ratings:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Score Range&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Severity&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>0.0&lt;/td>
&lt;td>None&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>0.1 - 3.9&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Low&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>4.0 - 6.9&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Medium&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>7.0 - 8.9&lt;/td>
&lt;td>High&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>9.0 - 10.0&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Critical&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;h3 id="reading-a-cvss-vector-string">Reading a CVSS Vector String&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The CVSS vector string encodes all the metric values in a compact format. For example:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H&lt;/code> — Score: 10.0 (Critical)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This describes &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228">Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228)&lt;/a>: exploitable over the network (AV:N), with low attack complexity (AC:L), requiring no privileges (PR:N) and no user interaction (UI:N), with changed scope (S:C), and high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compare with: &lt;code>CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N&lt;/code> — Score: 1.8 (Low)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This describes a vulnerability requiring local access, high complexity, high privileges, user interaction, and producing only low confidentiality impact — a much less severe threat.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cvss-v40">CVSS v4.0&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.first.org/cvss/v4-0/">CVSS v4.0&lt;/a> was released by FIRST.org in November 2023 and represents a significant evolution of the framework. While CVSS v3.1 remains the most widely used version (the NVD still primarily publishes v3.1 scores), v4.0 adoption is increasing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="key-changes-in-v40">Key Changes in v4.0&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>New metric groups.&lt;/strong> CVSS v4.0 restructures the scoring into four metric groups:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Base&lt;/strong> — Intrinsic vulnerability characteristics (similar to v3.1)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Threat&lt;/strong> — Replaces the Temporal group; focused on exploit maturity&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Environmental&lt;/strong> — Organization-specific adjustments&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Supplemental&lt;/strong> — Additional context that does not affect the score (e.g., safety impact, automatable, recovery)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Removed Scope metric.&lt;/strong> The Scope (S) metric from v3.1, which was widely considered confusing and inconsistently applied, has been removed. Its effects are captured through refined impact metrics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Attack Requirements.&lt;/strong> A new metric (AT) distinguishes between vulnerabilities that require specific deployment conditions and those that do not, providing more nuance than v3.1&amp;rsquo;s Attack Complexity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Multiple score types.&lt;/strong> CVSS v4.0 defines specific score types:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>CVSS-B: Base score only&lt;/li>
&lt;li>CVSS-BT: Base + Threat&lt;/li>
&lt;li>CVSS-BE: Base + Environmental&lt;/li>
&lt;li>CVSS-BTE: Base + Threat + Environmental (most complete)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="v31-vs-v40">v3.1 vs. v4.0&lt;/h3>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Aspect&lt;/th>
&lt;th>CVSS v3.1&lt;/th>
&lt;th>CVSS v4.0&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;strong>Metric groups&lt;/strong>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Base, Temporal, Environmental&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Base, Threat, Environmental, Supplemental&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;strong>Scope metric&lt;/strong>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Present (Unchanged/Changed)&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Removed&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;strong>Attack granularity&lt;/strong>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Attack Complexity (Low/High)&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Attack Complexity + Attack Requirements&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;strong>Score types&lt;/strong>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>One composite score&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Four named score types (B, BT, BE, BTE)&lt;/td>

&lt;td>Industry standard&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Growing adoption&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Both versions produce scores on the same 0.0-10.0 scale with the same severity ratings. A score of 9.8 means roughly the same severity in both versions, though the exact metrics contributing to that score may differ.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cvss-in-vulnerability-prioritization">CVSS in Vulnerability Prioritization&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>CVSS scores are essential for vulnerability prioritization, but they should not be the only signal.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="cvss-alone-is-not-enough">CVSS Alone Is Not Enough&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A CVSS Base Score measures theoretical severity — how bad the vulnerability &lt;em>could&lt;/em> be if exploited. It does not tell you:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Whether it is being exploited.&lt;/strong> The &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/30/what-is-kev-cisa-known-exploited-vulnerabilities/">CISA KEV catalog&lt;/a> answers this question. A CVSS 7.5 vulnerability that is actively exploited (KEV-listed) is more urgent than a CVSS 9.8 vulnerability with no known exploits.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Whether you are affected.&lt;/strong> A critical vulnerability in a component you do not use, or in a code path your application never reaches, represents zero actual risk to you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Your deployment context.&lt;/strong> A network-exploitable vulnerability in an internet-facing application is far more urgent than the same vulnerability in a completely internal tool.&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-cvss">What is CVSS?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an open framework maintained by FIRST.org for scoring the severity of software vulnerabilities on a scale of 0.0 to 10.0. Scores are calculated from metrics describing the vulnerability&amp;rsquo;s attack vector, complexity, required privileges, and potential impact. CVSS scores are published by the NVD for virtually every CVE and are the most widely used measure of vulnerability severity.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-a-good-cvss-score">What is a good CVSS score?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Lower CVSS scores indicate less severe vulnerabilities. A score of 0.0 means no impact. Scores of 0.1-3.9 are Low severity, 4.0-6.9 are Medium, 7.0-8.9 are High, and 9.0-10.0 are Critical. However, &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; depends on context — even a Medium vulnerability is urgent if it is being actively exploited (listed in the CISA KEV catalog) or in an internet-facing system.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-cvss-v31-and-v40">What is the difference between CVSS v3.1 and v4.0?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>CVSS v4.0 introduces refined metric groups (Base, Threat, Environmental, Supplemental), removes the controversial Scope metric, adds an Attack Requirements metric for more granular exploitability assessment, and defines four named score types (CVSS-B, CVSS-BT, CVSS-BE, CVSS-BTE). Both versions use the same 0.0-10.0 scale and severity ratings. CVSS v3.1 remains more widely deployed; v4.0 adoption is growing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-should-i-prioritize-vulnerabilities">How should I prioritize vulnerabilities?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Do not rely on CVSS scores alone. Combine CVSS severity with CISA KEV status (is it actively exploited?), EPSS probability (how likely is exploitation?), your SBOM (do you use the affected component?), and deployment context (is the vulnerable component exposed?). A KEV-listed vulnerability at CVSS 7.5 often warrants faster action than a non-exploited vulnerability at CVSS 9.8.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-epss">What is EPSS?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) is a model maintained by FIRST.org that estimates the probability that a CVE will be exploited in the wild in the next 30 days. EPSS scores range from 0 to 1 (0% to 100% probability). Used alongside CVSS and KEV, EPSS provides a forward-looking signal for vulnerability prioritization.&lt;/p></description><category>education</category></item><item><title>SBOM Scanning: How to Detect Vulnerabilities in Your Software Components</title><link>https://sbomify.com/2026/02/01/sbom-scanning-vulnerability-detection/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sbomify.com/2026/02/01/sbom-scanning-vulnerability-detection/</guid><description>&lt;p>SBOM scanning is the process of analyzing a &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/what-is-sbom/">Software Bill of Materials&lt;/a> to identify known vulnerabilities, license issues, and other risks in the components listed within it. Rather than re-analyzing source code or container images for each new vulnerability disclosure, SBOM scanning matches the component inventory already documented in your SBOM against vulnerability databases. This makes it possible to continuously monitor your entire software portfolio for newly disclosed threats without rescanning every artifact.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-sbom-scanning-works">How SBOM Scanning Works&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The SBOM scanning workflow has three stages:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="1-component-identification">1. Component Identification&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The scanner reads the SBOM and extracts component identifiers — primarily &lt;a href="https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec">Package URLs (purls)&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe">CPEs&lt;/a> — along with version information. These identifiers are the keys used to look up vulnerability data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A purl like &lt;code>pkg:npm/lodash@4.17.20&lt;/code> tells the scanner exactly which package (lodash), from which registry (npm), at which version (4.17.20) to check. The more precise your SBOM&amp;rsquo;s identifiers, the more accurate the scan results.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="2-database-matching">2. Database Matching&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The scanner queries one or more vulnerability databases to find known &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/18/cve-vulnerability-explained/">CVEs&lt;/a> affecting the identified components. Major databases include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/">National Vulnerability Database (NVD)&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> — The U.S. government&amp;rsquo;s comprehensive CVE database with &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/02/05/what-is-cvss-vulnerability-scoring/">CVSS&lt;/a> severity scores&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://osv.dev/">OSV (Open Source Vulnerabilities)&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> — Google&amp;rsquo;s database focused on open source package vulnerabilities, with ecosystem-specific advisory data&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://github.com/advisories">GitHub Advisory Database&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> — Community-curated advisories with package-manager-specific versioning&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">CISA KEV Catalog&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> — The list of vulnerabilities with confirmed &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/30/what-is-kev-cisa-known-exploited-vulnerabilities/">active exploitation&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="3-result-reporting">3. Result Reporting&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The scanner produces a report listing each vulnerability found, typically including:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The affected component and version&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The CVE identifier&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The CVSS severity score&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Whether the vulnerability is listed in the CISA KEV catalog&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fix availability (which version resolves the vulnerability)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Advisory details and references&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;h3 id="owasp-dependency-track">OWASP Dependency-Track&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://dependencytrack.org/">OWASP Dependency-Track&lt;/a> is a continuous SBOM analysis platform. Unlike CLI scanners that run once, Dependency-Track ingests SBOMs into a persistent database and continuously re-evaluates them as new vulnerabilities are published.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Key capabilities:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Ingests SBOMs in CycloneDX and SPDX formats via API or web upload&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Monitors against NVD, OSV, GitHub Advisories, and other sources&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Dependency-Track is particularly valuable for &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/18/sbom-management-best-practices/">SBOM management&lt;/a> at scale — it maintains a centralized view of all your software components and their vulnerability status.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="osv-scanner">OSV-Scanner&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/">OSV-Scanner&lt;/a> from Google uses the &lt;a href="https://osv.dev/">OSV database&lt;/a> and supports SBOM input. It focuses on open source package vulnerabilities with ecosystem-specific version matching.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a> integrates vulnerability monitoring directly into its SBOM management platform. When you upload SBOMs to sbomify, they are automatically scanned against &lt;a href="https://osv.dev/">Google OSV&lt;/a> for known vulnerabilities. For organizations needing deeper analysis, sbomify also integrates with &lt;a href="https://dependencytrack.org/">OWASP Dependency-Track&lt;/a>. This means generation, storage, scanning, and distribution happen in a single workflow rather than requiring separate tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a broader tool comparison, see our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/26/sbom-generation-tools-comparison/">SBOM generation tools guide&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/resources/">resources page&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="setting-up-continuous-monitoring">Setting Up Continuous Monitoring&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Point-in-time scanning catches vulnerabilities known at scan time but misses those disclosed afterward. Continuous monitoring solves this by repeatedly matching your SBOMs against updated vulnerability databases.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-workflow">The Workflow&lt;/h3>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Generate SBOMs&lt;/strong> in your CI/CD pipeline with every build using tools from our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/guides/">SBOM generation guides&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ingest SBOMs&lt;/strong> into a monitoring platform (&lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a>, OWASP Dependency-Track, or equivalent)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Configure data sources&lt;/strong> — connect the platform to NVD, OSV, KEV, and ecosystem-specific advisory feeds&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Set up notifications&lt;/strong> — alert the appropriate team when new vulnerabilities are found in their components&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Define policies&lt;/strong> — establish severity thresholds and SLAs for remediation&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="why-continuous-monitoring-matters">Why Continuous Monitoring Matters&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>New CVEs are published daily. A component that was clean when you deployed it may have a critical vulnerability disclosed a week later. Without continuous monitoring, you will not know until the next scheduled scan — which may be too late.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">CISA KEV catalog&lt;/a> is updated multiple times per week with vulnerabilities that are actively being exploited. Continuous monitoring against KEV ensures you are alerted immediately when a component in your portfolio is under active attack.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="acting-on-scan-results">Acting on Scan Results&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Scanning without action is overhead. An effective vulnerability response process turns scan results into remediation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="prioritization">Prioritization&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Not all vulnerabilities require immediate action. Prioritize based on:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>KEV status.&lt;/strong> If the vulnerability is in the &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/30/what-is-kev-cisa-known-exploited-vulnerabilities/">CISA KEV catalog&lt;/a>, it is being actively exploited — treat it as urgent regardless of CVSS score.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>CVSS severity.&lt;/strong> Critical (9.0-10.0) and High (7.0-8.9) vulnerabilities warrant faster response. See our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/02/05/what-is-cvss-vulnerability-scoring/">CVSS guide&lt;/a> for scoring details.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Exploitability.&lt;/strong> Is there a public exploit? Is the vulnerability exploitable remotely without authentication?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Deployment context.&lt;/strong> Is the affected component in an internet-facing application or an internal tool? Is the vulnerable code path actually reachable?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Fix availability.&lt;/strong> If a patched version exists, updating is straightforward. If no fix is available, you need a workaround or compensating control.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="remediation">Remediation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The most common remediation is updating the vulnerable component to a fixed version. For transitive dependencies, this may require updating the direct dependency that pulls it in — see our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/29/what-is-a-dependency-in-software/">dependency guide&lt;/a> for details on dependency trees.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When an update is not immediately possible:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Apply vendor-recommended mitigations or workarounds&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Implement compensating controls (WAF rules, network restrictions)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Document the accepted risk with a timeline for permanent remediation&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="vex-vulnerability-exploitability-exchange">VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange)&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>VEX is a standardized way to communicate whether a vulnerability in a component actually affects a specific product. A VEX statement might declare that CVE-2024-XXXX in lodash &amp;ldquo;does not affect&amp;rdquo; your application because the vulnerable function is never called.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VEX reduces false positives by distinguishing between &amp;ldquo;this component has a known CVE&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;this CVE actually impacts our product.&amp;rdquo; Both &lt;a href="https://cyclonedx.org/">CycloneDX&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/openvex">OpenVEX&lt;/a> support VEX documents that can be consumed by scanning tools to suppress known non-exploitable findings.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="best-practices">Best Practices&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Scan SBOMs, not just source code.&lt;/strong> SBOM scanning catches vulnerabilities in deployed components, including OS-level packages in &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/03/container-security-best-practices/">containers&lt;/a> that do not appear in your source repository.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Monitor continuously.&lt;/strong> Do not rely on scan-at-build-time alone. Use a platform like &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a> or OWASP Dependency-Track for ongoing monitoring against updated vulnerability feeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Prioritize with KEV.&lt;/strong> Use the CISA KEV catalog as a top-priority signal. KEV-listed vulnerabilities are confirmed to be actively exploited and should be remediated first.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Define SLAs.&lt;/strong> Establish clear timelines for remediation based on severity and exploitability. Example: KEV-listed critical vulnerabilities within 48 hours; critical non-KEV within 2 weeks; high severity within 30 days.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Use VEX to reduce noise.&lt;/strong> When a vulnerability does not affect your product (because the vulnerable code path is not reachable), document this with a VEX statement rather than suppressing the alert entirely.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Automate the pipeline.&lt;/strong> Generate SBOMs automatically in CI/CD, ingest them into monitoring automatically, and route alerts to the right teams automatically. Manual steps create gaps.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-sbom-scanning">What is SBOM scanning?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>SBOM scanning is the process of analyzing a Software Bill of Materials to identify known vulnerabilities, license issues, and other risks in the components it documents. Scanners match SBOM component identifiers (purls, CPEs) against vulnerability databases like the NVD and OSV to find known CVEs. This enables continuous vulnerability monitoring without repeatedly scanning source code or container images.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-tools-scan-sboms-for-vulnerabilities">What tools scan SBOMs for vulnerabilities?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Leading SBOM scanning tools include &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a> (integrated platform with built-in OSV and Dependency-Track scanning), Grype (CLI scanner from Anchore), OWASP Dependency-Track (standalone monitoring platform), OSV-Scanner (Google&amp;rsquo;s open source scanner), and Trivy (comprehensive security scanner from Aqua Security). Grype and Trivy are best for CI/CD pipeline integration; sbomify and Dependency-Track are best for ongoing portfolio monitoring.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-often-should-i-scan-my-sboms">How often should I scan my SBOMs?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>SBOMs should be scanned continuously, not just at build time. New vulnerabilities are disclosed daily, and a component that was clean at build time may have a critical CVE disclosed afterward. Use a continuous monitoring platform that automatically re-evaluates your SBOMs as vulnerability databases are updated.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-sbom-scanning-and-sca">What is the difference between SBOM scanning and SCA?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/11/software-composition-analysis-sca/">Software Composition Analysis (SCA)&lt;/a> scans source code, dependency files, or binaries to identify components and their vulnerabilities. SBOM scanning takes an already-generated SBOM as input and matches its components against vulnerability databases. SCA produces the inventory; SBOM scanning monitors it over time. They are complementary — SCA for discovery, SBOM scanning for continuous monitoring.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-vex">What is VEX?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange) is a standardized format for communicating whether a known vulnerability in a component actually affects a specific product. A VEX statement can declare that a CVE &amp;ldquo;does not affect,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;is under investigation,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;is affected&amp;rdquo; in your product. VEX reduces false positives from SBOM scanning by distinguishing theoretical vulnerability from actual impact.&lt;/p></description><category>education</category></item><item><title>SBOM Management: How to Organize, Track, and Act on Your SBOMs</title><link>https://sbomify.com/2026/01/18/sbom-management-best-practices/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sbomify.com/2026/01/18/sbom-management-best-practices/</guid><description>&lt;p>SBOM management is the practice of organizing, storing, versioning, distributing, and acting on &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/what-is-sbom/">Software Bills of Materials&lt;/a> across an organization&amp;rsquo;s software portfolio. Generating an SBOM is only the first step. Without a management process, SBOMs become stale documents that sit unused. Effective SBOM management turns component inventories into an operational tool for vulnerability response, compliance reporting, and supply chain risk reduction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://sbomify.com/assets/images/d2/sbom-management-lifecycle.svg" alt="SBOM management lifecycle from generation through storage and monitoring to action">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-sbom-management-matters">Why SBOM Management Matters&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Most organizations that begin their SBOM journey focus on generation — using tools like &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/anchore/syft">Syft&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy">Trivy&lt;/a>, or &lt;a href="https://github.com/CycloneDX/cdxgen">cdxgen&lt;/a> to produce SBOMs from their projects (see our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/resources/">resources page&lt;/a> for a complete list). This is necessary but insufficient. An SBOM that is generated once and never updated or monitored provides little ongoing value.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The real benefits of SBOMs — rapid vulnerability response, continuous compliance, supply chain visibility — only materialize when SBOMs are actively managed. Consider the &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228">Log4Shell&lt;/a> disclosure in December 2021: organizations with up-to-date, searchable SBOMs identified affected systems in minutes. Organizations without them spent weeks manually auditing codebases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SBOM management addresses three challenges:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Scale.&lt;/strong> A mid-sized organization may have hundreds of applications, each with its own SBOM containing hundreds of components. Managing this manually is not feasible.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Currency.&lt;/strong> Software changes with every commit. SBOMs must be regenerated and updated to reflect the current state of deployed software.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Actionability.&lt;/strong> An SBOM is only useful if it can be queried, monitored, and correlated with new threat intelligence. Storage without analysis is archival, not management.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="the-sbom-lifecycle">The SBOM Lifecycle&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The SBOM lifecycle mirrors the structure outlined on our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/resources/">resources page&lt;/a>: generation, distribution, and analysis. Management spans all three phases.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="phase-1-generation">Phase 1: Generation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>SBOM generation should be automated in your CI/CD pipeline so that every build produces a current SBOM. Key considerations:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Format choice.&lt;/strong> Select &lt;a href="https://cyclonedx.org/">CycloneDX&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://spdx.dev/">SPDX&lt;/a> based on your compliance requirements and tooling. See our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/15/sbom-formats-cyclonedx-vs-spdx/">SBOM formats comparison&lt;/a> for guidance. Many organizations generate in both formats.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Generation point.&lt;/strong> Generate SBOMs at build time from resolved dependency trees (lock files, built artifacts), not from unresolved manifests. Build-time SBOMs capture the exact versions that will be deployed, including transitive dependencies.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Automation.&lt;/strong> Integrate SBOM generation into your CI/CD pipeline using tools like the &lt;a href="https://github.com/sbomify/github-action/">sbomify GitHub Action&lt;/a>. Every release should produce an SBOM automatically.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Completeness.&lt;/strong> Ensure SBOMs capture all layers. For &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/03/container-security-best-practices/">containerized applications&lt;/a>, this means generating container-level SBOMs that include base image packages in addition to application dependencies.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>For language-specific generation instructions, see our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/guides/">SBOM guides&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="phase-2-storage-and-versioning">Phase 2: Storage and Versioning&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Generated SBOMs need a durable, queryable storage location. Approaches range from simple to sophisticated:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Artifact repository.&lt;/strong> Store SBOMs alongside the build artifacts they describe. If you use a container registry, attach SBOMs to container images using OCI artifacts. If you use a package registry, publish SBOMs as companion files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Dedicated SBOM platform.&lt;/strong> Use a purpose-built platform like &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a> that ingests, indexes, and monitors SBOMs across your portfolio. sbomify organizes SBOMs in a hierarchy of Products, Projects, and Components — matching how software is actually built — and provides centralized visibility, search, and policy enforcement. Its &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/features/trust-center/">Trust Center&lt;/a> feature also handles distribution to customers and auditors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Version control.&lt;/strong> Each SBOM should be versioned in lockstep with the software it describes. When version 2.1.3 of your application is released, the SBOM for 2.1.3 should be generated and stored. Previous versions should be retained for audit and incident response purposes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Retention policy.&lt;/strong> Define how long SBOMs are retained. At minimum, retain SBOMs for all currently deployed versions. For compliance, retain SBOMs for the duration required by your applicable frameworks — the &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/eu-cra/">EU CRA&lt;/a> requires vulnerability handling for the expected product lifetime or a minimum of five years.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="phase-3-monitoring-and-analysis">Phase 3: Monitoring and Analysis&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This is where SBOMs deliver their highest value. Continuous monitoring matches your SBOM components against vulnerability databases and threat intelligence feeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Vulnerability monitoring.&lt;/strong> Ingest SBOMs into a management platform like &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a> (which integrates Google OSV and &lt;a href="https://dependencytrack.org/">OWASP Dependency-Track&lt;/a>) or a standalone instance of Dependency-Track. These platforms continuously match components against the &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/">NVD&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://osv.dev/">OSV&lt;/a>, and the &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">CISA KEV catalog&lt;/a>. When a new &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/18/cve-vulnerability-explained/">CVE&lt;/a> is published, the platform immediately identifies which of your products are affected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>License compliance.&lt;/strong> Monitor for license conflicts and policy violations. Automated tools can flag &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/22/gpl-license-guide/">GPL&lt;/a> dependencies in proprietary products, &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/07/apache-license-2-guide/">Apache 2.0 / GPLv2 incompatibilities&lt;/a>, or components with unknown licenses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Component lifecycle tracking.&lt;/strong> Monitor for end-of-life and end-of-support components. Dependencies that are no longer maintained represent a growing risk as new vulnerabilities go unpatched.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Policy enforcement.&lt;/strong> Define organizational policies (e.g., &amp;ldquo;no components with critical KEV-listed vulnerabilities in production,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;no AGPL-licensed components in SaaS products&amp;rdquo;) and monitor compliance across your portfolio.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="sbom-distribution">SBOM Distribution&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>SBOMs are not just internal documents. Increasingly, they must be shared with customers, regulators, and supply chain partners.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="who-receives-sboms">Who Receives SBOMs&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Customers&lt;/strong> requesting SBOMs as part of procurement or vendor assessment&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Regulators&lt;/strong> requiring SBOMs under frameworks like &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/eo-14028/">EO 14028&lt;/a> or the &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/eu-cra/">EU CRA&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Internal teams&lt;/strong> consuming software from other teams within the organization&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Auditors&lt;/strong> conducting security assessments or due diligence&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="distribution-methods">Distribution Methods&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Companion file.&lt;/strong> Publish the SBOM alongside the software release (e.g., in the GitHub release assets, alongside Docker images in a registry)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>API access.&lt;/strong> Provide programmatic access to SBOMs through a dedicated API endpoint&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Dedicated platform.&lt;/strong> Use an SBOM management platform like &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/features/trust-center/">sbomify&amp;rsquo;s Trust Center&lt;/a> that provides a branded portal with controlled access to SBOMs and compliance documents for authorized consumers&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="what-to-include">What to Include&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Follow the &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/ntia-minimum-elements/">NTIA minimum elements&lt;/a> as a baseline for SBOM content: supplier name, component name, component version, unique identifiers, dependency relationships, SBOM author, and timestamp. The &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/cisa-minimum-elements/">CISA minimum elements draft&lt;/a> adds recommended fields including license information and lifecycle/generation context.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="organizing-sboms-at-scale">Organizing SBOMs at Scale&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As the number of SBOMs grows, organization becomes critical.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="by-product-and-version">By Product and Version&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The most natural organization maps SBOMs to the products and versions they describe. Each product-version combination should have exactly one authoritative SBOM. For products composed of multiple services or components, consider a hierarchical approach: a top-level SBOM for the product that references component-level SBOMs for each service.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="by-deployment-environment">By Deployment Environment&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Different environments (development, staging, production) may run different versions. Track which SBOM corresponds to what is currently deployed in each environment. This is especially important for incident response — when a new vulnerability is disclosed, you need to know what is in production right now, not what was released last quarter.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="by-supply-chain-position">By Supply Chain Position&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you both consume and produce software, maintain SBOMs in both directions: SBOMs you receive from your suppliers (upstream) and SBOMs you generate for your products (downstream). Correlating upstream SBOMs with downstream products lets you trace how a supplier vulnerability propagates through your software.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="best-practices">Best Practices&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Automate generation in CI/CD.&lt;/strong> Never generate SBOMs manually. Integrate SBOM generation into your build pipeline so every release is automatically documented. See our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/guides/">SBOM generation guides&lt;/a> for language-specific instructions.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Monitor continuously.&lt;/strong> Set up automated vulnerability monitoring against your SBOMs. New CVEs are published daily; manual cross-referencing does not scale. &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a> provides integrated monitoring via Google OSV and OWASP Dependency-Track.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Version SBOMs with releases.&lt;/strong> Every software release should produce a corresponding SBOM. Store them together so you always know the component composition of any deployed version.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Define retention and distribution policies.&lt;/strong> Decide how long SBOMs are retained, who has access, and how they are shared with external consumers. Align retention with your compliance obligations.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Centralize visibility.&lt;/strong> As your SBOM inventory grows, centralize it in a platform that supports search, filtering, and cross-portfolio analysis. Being able to answer &amp;ldquo;which of our products use Log4j?&amp;rdquo; in seconds is the goal.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Keep SBOMs current.&lt;/strong> A stale SBOM is worse than no SBOM — it provides false confidence. Ensure that deployed software always has a corresponding current SBOM. Flag and investigate any deployed artifacts without an associated SBOM.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Act on findings.&lt;/strong> SBOM management is not complete without a remediation process. When monitoring surfaces a vulnerability, define SLAs for response based on severity, &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/30/what-is-kev-cisa-known-exploited-vulnerabilities/">KEV status&lt;/a>, and deployment context.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-sbom-management">What is SBOM management?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>SBOM management is the practice of organizing, storing, versioning, distributing, and continuously monitoring Software Bills of Materials across an organization&amp;rsquo;s software portfolio. It encompasses the entire SBOM lifecycle: automated generation in CI/CD, durable storage with version tracking, continuous vulnerability monitoring against databases like the NVD and CISA KEV, license compliance checking, and distribution to customers and regulators.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-is-sbom-management-important">Why is SBOM management important?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Generating an SBOM is only the first step. Without management, SBOMs quickly become stale and unused. SBOM management enables rapid vulnerability response (identifying affected products in seconds when a new CVE is disclosed), continuous compliance monitoring, and supply chain visibility at scale. Organizations with hundreds of applications and thousands of dependencies cannot manage software composition manually.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-tools-are-used-for-sbom-management">What tools are used for SBOM management?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Key tools include &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a> for integrated SBOM management (generation, storage, monitoring, and distribution in one platform), OWASP Dependency-Track for standalone vulnerability monitoring, and Grype for CLI-based scanning. For generation-only tools, Syft, Trivy, and cdxgen produce SBOMs in CycloneDX or SPDX format. For a comprehensive listing, see our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/resources/">SBOM resources page&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-often-should-sboms-be-updated">How often should SBOMs be updated?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>SBOMs should be regenerated with every software release and ideally with every build in your CI/CD pipeline. The SBOM for a deployed application should always reflect its current composition. Additionally, SBOMs should be continuously monitored against vulnerability databases, as new CVEs are published daily that may affect previously scanned components.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-should-be-included-in-an-sbom">What should be included in an SBOM?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>At minimum, follow the NTIA minimum elements: supplier name, component name, component version, unique identifiers (purl or CPE), dependency relationships, SBOM author, and timestamp. The CISA minimum elements draft adds license information and generation context. For compliance with specific frameworks, check the requirements on our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/">compliance overview page&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description><category>education</category></item><item><title>Software Composition Analysis (SCA): What It Is and How SBOMs Fit In</title><link>https://sbomify.com/2026/01/11/software-composition-analysis-sca/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sbomify.com/2026/01/11/software-composition-analysis-sca/</guid><description>&lt;p>Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is a category of application security tooling that identifies open source and third-party components in a codebase, catalogs their licenses, and detects known vulnerabilities associated with those components. SCA tools work by analyzing dependency manifests, lock files, and sometimes compiled binaries to produce an inventory of components that can be matched against vulnerability databases like the &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/">National Vulnerability Database&lt;/a> (NVD) and the &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">CISA KEV catalog&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://sbomify.com/assets/images/d2/sca-workflow.svg" alt="SCA workflow from source analysis through component identification to vulnerability matching">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-software-composition-analysis">What Is Software Composition Analysis?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Software Composition Analysis addresses a fundamental reality of modern software development: most applications are not written from scratch. Studies consistently show that &lt;a href="https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/estimating-total-number-linux-contributors-approach-using-linus-law/">70-90% of a typical application consists of open source components&lt;/a> pulled from package registries like npm, PyPI, Maven Central, and crates.io. Each of these components introduces potential security vulnerabilities, license obligations, and maintenance risks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SCA tools automate the process of identifying these components and their associated risks. Without SCA, development teams would need to manually track every library version across every project — an approach that does not scale given the pace of vulnerability disclosure (the NVD published over 28,000 CVEs in 2023 alone).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The core functions of SCA are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Component identification.&lt;/strong> Scanning source code, dependency files, and sometimes binaries to produce a complete inventory of third-party components, including &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/29/what-is-a-dependency-in-software/">transitive dependencies&lt;/a> — the dependencies of your dependencies.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Vulnerability detection.&lt;/strong> Matching identified components against vulnerability databases to flag known &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/18/cve-vulnerability-explained/">CVEs&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>License compliance.&lt;/strong> Identifying the license of each component and flagging potential conflicts or compliance obligations, such as &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/22/gpl-license-guide/">GPL copyleft requirements&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Policy enforcement.&lt;/strong> Allowing organizations to define rules (e.g., &amp;ldquo;block any component with a critical CVE&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;reject AGPL-licensed dependencies&amp;rdquo;) and enforce them in CI/CD pipelines.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="how-sca-tools-work">How SCA Tools Work&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>SCA tools typically operate through one or more of these analysis methods:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="manifest-and-lock-file-analysis">Manifest and Lock File Analysis&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The most common approach. SCA tools parse dependency declaration files — &lt;code>package.json&lt;/code> and &lt;code>package-lock.json&lt;/code> (JavaScript), &lt;code>requirements.txt&lt;/code> and &lt;code>poetry.lock&lt;/code> (Python), &lt;code>pom.xml&lt;/code> (Java), &lt;code>go.sum&lt;/code> (Go), &lt;code>Cargo.lock&lt;/code> (Rust), and similar files for other ecosystems. This provides a definitive list of declared dependencies and their resolved versions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="source-code-scanning">Source Code Scanning&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Some SCA tools scan source code files to detect component usage that may not be declared in manifests — for example, vendored code (source files copied directly into a repository rather than managed through a package manager), or code snippets pulled from Stack Overflow or other sources.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="binary-analysis">Binary Analysis&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Binary SCA analyzes compiled artifacts (executables, container images, firmware) to identify embedded components. This is essential when source code is not available, such as when evaluating third-party commercial software or auditing firmware. Binary analysis is less precise than manifest analysis but covers a broader set of use cases.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="dependency-resolution">Dependency Resolution&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Advanced SCA tools resolve the full dependency tree, including transitive dependencies. A project that declares 10 direct dependencies may actually depend on hundreds of transitive packages. SCA tools that only examine direct dependencies miss the majority of the attack surface.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="sca-vs-sast-vs-dast">SCA vs. SAST vs. DAST&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>SCA is one of several application security testing approaches. Each addresses different risk categories and operates at different points in the &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/15/software-development-life-cycle-sdlc-sbom-integration/">software development life cycle&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>

&lt;td>Third-party and open source components&lt;/td>

&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>

&lt;td>Low (matches known CVEs to exact versions)&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Moderate to high&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Low to moderate&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>

&lt;td>Does not find dependency vulnerabilities&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Does not find issues in code paths not exercised&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>These tools are complementary. A comprehensive application security program uses all three:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>SCA&lt;/strong> catches known vulnerabilities in the 70-90% of your application that you did not write&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>SAST&lt;/strong> catches coding flaws in the 10-30% that you did write&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>DAST&lt;/strong> catches runtime issues that only manifest in a deployed environment&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="sca-tools">SCA Tools&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Several tools provide SCA capabilities. The ecosystem spans open source and commercial offerings.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="sca-and-sboms">SCA and SBOMs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>SCA tools and &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/what-is-sbom/">SBOMs&lt;/a> are closely related but serve different purposes. Understanding the relationship helps you build a more effective security program.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="sca-generates-sboms">SCA Generates SBOMs&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Many SCA tools produce SBOMs as an output of their analysis. The &lt;a href="https://github.com/sbomify/github-action/">sbomify GitHub Action&lt;/a> generates SBOMs and automatically enriches them with license, hash, and lifecycle metadata from 11+ data sources. Standalone tools like &lt;a href="https://github.com/anchore/syft">Syft&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy">Trivy&lt;/a> also generate SBOMs in standard formats (&lt;a href="https://cyclonedx.org/">CycloneDX&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://spdx.dev/">SPDX&lt;/a>). In this sense, SCA is one of the primary methods for &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/guides/">SBOM generation&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="sboms-enable-continuous-sca">SBOMs Enable Continuous SCA&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A generated SBOM can be ingested by management platforms like &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://dependencytrack.org/">OWASP Dependency-Track&lt;/a> for continuous analysis. Instead of re-scanning your entire codebase every time a new CVE is published, the platform matches new vulnerabilities against your existing SBOM inventory. This is particularly valuable for monitoring production deployments where source code may not be readily accessible.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="sboms-go-beyond-sca">SBOMs Go Beyond SCA&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>While SCA focuses on vulnerability detection and license compliance, SBOMs serve a broader purpose:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Regulatory compliance.&lt;/strong> Frameworks like &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/eo-14028/">Executive Order 14028&lt;/a>, the &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/eu-cra/">EU Cyber Resilience Act&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/fda-medical-device/">FDA medical device guidance&lt;/a> require SBOMs as a compliance artifact — not just SCA scan results.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Supply chain transparency.&lt;/strong> SBOMs document the provenance and composition of software for consumers, auditors, and regulators.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Incident response.&lt;/strong> When a vulnerability like &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228">Log4Shell&lt;/a> is disclosed, SBOMs allow you to immediately identify affected products without re-running scans.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>For organizations building a security program, SCA tools are the engine and SBOMs are the artifact. Use SCA to scan and detect; use SBOMs to document, share, and continuously monitor.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="best-practices">Best Practices&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Integrate SCA into CI/CD.&lt;/strong> Run SCA scans on every build and pull request. Catching vulnerable dependencies before they reach production is far less costly than remediating them after deployment.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Monitor continuously, not just at build time.&lt;/strong> New vulnerabilities are disclosed daily. Use SBOM-based monitoring with platforms like &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://dependencytrack.org/">OWASP Dependency-Track&lt;/a> to catch newly disclosed CVEs in your already-deployed components.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Resolve the full dependency tree.&lt;/strong> Ensure your SCA tool analyzes transitive dependencies, not just direct ones. The majority of vulnerable components in most projects are transitive.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Define and enforce policies.&lt;/strong> Establish clear rules for vulnerability severity thresholds, license restrictions, and acceptable risk. Automate enforcement in your pipeline to prevent policy violations from reaching production.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Combine SCA with SAST and DAST.&lt;/strong> SCA only finds known vulnerabilities in third-party code. Pair it with SAST for your own code and DAST for runtime testing to cover all three risk categories.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Generate SBOMs from SCA output.&lt;/strong> Use your SCA tool&amp;rsquo;s SBOM generation capability to produce machine-readable component inventories in &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/15/sbom-formats-cyclonedx-vs-spdx/">CycloneDX or SPDX format&lt;/a>. These SBOMs serve both security monitoring and compliance purposes.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-software-composition-analysis-1">What is software composition analysis?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is a category of security tooling that identifies open source and third-party components in your software, detects known vulnerabilities in those components by matching them against databases like the NVD, and catalogs their licenses for compliance purposes. SCA tools analyze dependency manifests, lock files, and sometimes binaries to produce a complete component inventory.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-sca-and-sast">What is the difference between SCA and SAST?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>SCA analyzes third-party and open source components in your application for known vulnerabilities and license issues. SAST (Static Application Security Testing) analyzes your own source code for coding flaws like injection vulnerabilities, authentication bypasses, and logic errors. SCA covers the 70-90% of your application that is third-party code; SAST covers the code you wrote yourself. Both are needed for comprehensive application security.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-does-sca-relate-to-sboms">How does SCA relate to SBOMs?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>SCA tools are one of the primary methods for generating SBOMs. When an SCA tool scans your project and identifies all components, that inventory can be exported as an SBOM in standard formats like CycloneDX or SPDX. Conversely, SBOMs enable continuous SCA by providing a persistent component inventory that can be monitored against new vulnerability disclosures without re-scanning source code.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-are-the-best-open-source-sca-tools">What are the best open source SCA tools?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Leading open source SCA tools include Grype (vulnerability scanner from Anchore), OWASP Dependency-Track (continuous SBOM analysis platform), OWASP Dependency-Check (mature CVE detection tool), OSV-Scanner (Google&amp;rsquo;s vulnerability scanner using the OSV database), and Trivy (comprehensive scanner from Aqua Security). Choice depends on your ecosystem, integration requirements, and whether you need CLI scanning, CI/CD integration, or continuous monitoring.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="does-sca-find-all-vulnerabilities">Does SCA find all vulnerabilities?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>No. SCA finds known vulnerabilities in third-party components — those that have been assigned CVE identifiers and added to vulnerability databases. It does not find zero-day vulnerabilities (those not yet publicly known), vulnerabilities in your own code, or runtime configuration issues. SCA should be combined with SAST, DAST, and penetration testing for comprehensive coverage.&lt;/p></description><category>education</category></item><item><title>What Is a KEV?

The &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog&lt;/a>, maintained by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, is the authoritative list of these vulnerabilities. Unlike CVE databases that catalog all publicly known flaws, or CVSS scores that estimate theoretical severity, the KEV catalog answers a more urgent question: &lt;em>is this vulnerability being exploited right now?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://sbomify.com/assets/images/d2/vulnerability-prioritization.svg" alt="Vulnerability prioritization flow from CVE through CVSS and KEV to SBOM-based remediation">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-kev-catalog">What Is the KEV Catalog?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The CISA KEV catalog is a curated list of &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/18/cve-vulnerability-explained/">CVE&lt;/a> vulnerabilities that have reliable evidence of active exploitation. CISA launched the catalog in November 2021 alongside &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/bod-22-01-reducing-significant-risk-known-exploited-vulnerabilities">Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01&lt;/a>, which requires U.S. federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate KEV-listed vulnerabilities within specified timeframes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As of early 2026, the KEV catalog contains nearly 1,500 entries. New vulnerabilities are added as CISA confirms evidence of exploitation, and each entry includes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>CVE ID&lt;/strong> identifying the vulnerability&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Vendor and product&lt;/strong> affected&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Vulnerability name&lt;/strong> and description&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Date added&lt;/strong> to the catalog&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Due date&lt;/strong> for federal agency remediation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Required action&lt;/strong> (typically &amp;ldquo;Apply updates per vendor instructions&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Known ransomware campaign use&lt;/strong> (yes/no flag)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The catalog is freely available as a &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/feeds/known_exploited_vulnerabilities.json">JSON feed&lt;/a>, a &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/csv/known_exploited_vulnerabilities.csv">CSV download&lt;/a>, and through the CISA website.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="kev-vs-cve-vs-cvss-how-they-work-together">KEV vs. CVE vs. CVSS: How They Work Together&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>These three systems are complementary, not competing. Each answers a different question in the vulnerability management process.&lt;/p>

&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>A CVE tells you a vulnerability exists. CVSS tells you how bad it &lt;em>could&lt;/em> be. KEV tells you it &lt;em>is&lt;/em> being exploited. Effective vulnerability prioritization uses all three signals together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consider two vulnerabilities, both with CVSS scores of 9.8 (Critical). One is listed in the KEV catalog; the other is not. The KEV-listed vulnerability should be patched first because there is confirmed evidence that attackers are actively exploiting it, whereas the other, while theoretically severe, may not have working exploits in circulation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="binding-operational-directive-22-01">Binding Operational Directive 22-01&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/directives/bod-22-01-reducing-significant-risk-known-exploited-vulnerabilities">BOD 22-01&lt;/a> (&amp;ldquo;Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities&amp;rdquo;) is the CISA directive that established the KEV catalog&amp;rsquo;s operational role. It requires FCEB agencies to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Review&lt;/strong> the KEV catalog on an ongoing basis&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Remediate&lt;/strong> each KEV vulnerability by the due date specified in the catalog&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Report&lt;/strong> their remediation status to CISA&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>While BOD 22-01 only legally binds federal civilian agencies, CISA strongly recommends that all organizations — including state and local governments, critical infrastructure operators, and private sector companies — use the KEV catalog as a prioritization input for their vulnerability management programs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The remediation timelines in BOD 22-01 are aggressive. Newly added KEVs typically have due dates of two to three weeks from the date of addition. This reflects the urgency: if a vulnerability is being actively exploited, delayed patching means continued exposure.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-the-kev-catalog-is-maintained">How the KEV Catalog Is Maintained&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>CISA adds vulnerabilities to the KEV catalog based on three criteria, all of which must be met:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The vulnerability has an assigned CVE ID.&lt;/strong> Only cataloged vulnerabilities with standard identifiers qualify.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is reliable evidence of active exploitation.&lt;/strong> This evidence may come from CISA&amp;rsquo;s own threat intelligence, reports from federal agencies, industry partners, or trusted cybersecurity organizations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A clear remediation action exists.&lt;/strong> Typically this means a vendor patch or mitigation is available. CISA does not add vulnerabilities for which there is no known fix, as doing so would disclose exploited flaws without offering a path to resolution.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Vulnerabilities are rarely removed from the KEV catalog once added — even after the remediation deadline passes. While CISA has removed entries in rare cases where evidence of exploitation was later found insufficient, the catalog serves primarily as a persistent historical record of exploitation activity.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="using-the-kev-catalog-for-patch-prioritization">Using the KEV Catalog for Patch Prioritization&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Most organizations face far more vulnerabilities than they can patch simultaneously. The KEV catalog provides a practical prioritization signal that cuts through the noise.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="a-prioritization-framework">A Prioritization Framework&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A common approach combines CVSS severity with KEV status and deployment context:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Critical + KEV-listed + Internet-facing&lt;/strong> — Patch immediately (within 24-48 hours)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Critical + KEV-listed + Internal&lt;/strong> — Patch within the BOD 22-01 deadline (typically 2-3 weeks)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Critical + Not KEV-listed&lt;/strong> — Patch within standard SLA (typically 30 days)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>High + KEV-listed&lt;/strong> — Treat as critical; patch within 2-3 weeks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>High + Not KEV-listed&lt;/strong> — Patch within standard SLA&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Medium/Low + Not KEV-listed&lt;/strong> — Schedule for regular maintenance windows&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This framework is a starting point. Organizations should adjust based on their risk tolerance, asset criticality, and compensating controls.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-ransomware-flag">The Ransomware Flag&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Since October 2023, CISA has included a &amp;ldquo;Known Ransomware Campaign Use&amp;rdquo; flag in KEV entries, as part of its Ransomware Vulnerability Warning Pilot (RVWP). This binary indicator (yes/no) signals whether the vulnerability has been used in ransomware operations. Vulnerabilities flagged for ransomware use warrant heightened urgency due to the potential for data encryption and operational disruption.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="kev-and-sboms-automated-monitoring">KEV and SBOMs: Automated Monitoring&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The real power of the KEV catalog emerges when combined with &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/what-is-sbom/">SBOMs&lt;/a>. An SBOM provides a machine-readable inventory of every component in your software. The KEV catalog provides a machine-readable list of actively exploited vulnerabilities. Connecting the two creates automated, continuous monitoring.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-it-works">How It Works&lt;/h3>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Generate SBOMs&lt;/strong> for all your applications using tools from our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/guides/">SBOM generation guides&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ingest SBOMs&lt;/strong> into a management platform such as &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://dependencytrack.org/">OWASP Dependency-Track&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Run vulnerability analysis&lt;/strong> — tools like Google OSV and Dependency-Track identify known CVEs in your SBOM components&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Cross-reference with KEV&lt;/strong> — check which of those CVEs appear in the KEV catalog to identify actively exploited vulnerabilities&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Prioritize remediation&lt;/strong> using the KEV due date and your deployment context&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Because CISA adds new KEVs multiple times per week, building this cross-referencing into your workflow is important. The KEV catalog&amp;rsquo;s machine-readable formats make this feasible to automate.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="integration-points">Integration Points&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Several tools and data sources support KEV-SBOM workflows:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/feeds/known_exploited_vulnerabilities.json">CISA KEV JSON feed&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> — Machine-readable, updated as new KEVs are added&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> — SBOM management platform with vulnerability analysis via Google OSV integration&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://dependencytrack.org/">OWASP Dependency-Track&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> — Ingests SBOMs and performs vulnerability analysis using multiple data sources&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>For a comprehensive list of analysis tools, see our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/resources/">SBOM resources page&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="kev-in-the-compliance-context">KEV in the Compliance Context&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The KEV catalog intersects with several compliance frameworks:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/eo-14028/">Executive Order 14028&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> directs agencies to improve vulnerability management, and KEV provides the prioritization mechanism.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/cisa-minimum-elements/">CISA minimum elements&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> recommend unique identifiers (like purl or CPE) in SBOMs, enabling automated matching against KEV entries.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/nist-800-53/">NIST SP 800-53&lt;/a> SI-5&lt;/strong> requires receiving and acting on security alerts and advisories — the KEV catalog is a primary source for this control.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/eu-cra/">EU CRA&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> requires vulnerability handling processes, and KEV status is a valuable input for prioritizing which vulnerabilities to address first.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-a-kev">What is a KEV?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A KEV (Known Exploited Vulnerability) is a CVE vulnerability that CISA has confirmed is being actively exploited in real-world attacks. The CISA KEV catalog lists these vulnerabilities along with remediation deadlines and required actions. Being listed in the KEV catalog means the vulnerability is not just theoretically dangerous — it is being used by attackers right now.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-the-kev-catalog-1">What is the KEV catalog?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog is a curated, continuously updated list of CVE vulnerabilities with confirmed active exploitation. Established by Binding Operational Directive 22-01, it requires U.S. federal agencies to remediate listed vulnerabilities within specified timeframes. The catalog is freely available as JSON, CSV, and via the CISA website, and is widely used by both government and private sector organizations for patch prioritization.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-is-kev-different-from-cve">How is KEV different from CVE?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>CVE is a system for assigning unique identifiers to all publicly known vulnerabilities, regardless of whether they are being exploited. The KEV catalog is a curated subset of CVEs that have confirmed evidence of active exploitation. There are over 330,000 CVE entries but only about 1,500 KEV entries. A CVE tells you a vulnerability exists; a KEV listing tells you attackers are actively using it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="who-must-comply-with-the-kev-catalog">Who must comply with the KEV catalog?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>BOD 22-01 legally requires U.S. federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate KEV-listed vulnerabilities by the specified due dates. However, CISA strongly recommends that all organizations use the KEV catalog for prioritization. Many private sector organizations, state and local governments, and critical infrastructure operators have adopted KEV as a standard input to their vulnerability management programs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-can-i-monitor-the-kev-catalog-automatically">How can I monitor the KEV catalog automatically?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Generate SBOMs for your applications, ingest them into a vulnerability management platform like OWASP Dependency-Track, and use vulnerability analysis to identify known CVEs in your components. Then cross-reference those CVEs against the KEV catalog. CISA publishes the KEV catalog as a machine-readable &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/feeds/known_exploited_vulnerabilities.json">JSON feed&lt;/a> that can be consumed by automated tools.&lt;/p></description><category>education</category></item><item><title>CVE Vulnerabilities Explained: What They Are and Why They Matter</title><link>https://sbomify.com/2025/12/18/cve-vulnerability-explained/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sbomify.com/2025/12/18/cve-vulnerability-explained/</guid><description>&lt;p>A CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) is a standardized identifier assigned to a publicly known cybersecurity vulnerability. Each CVE entry provides a unique ID, a description, and references to related advisories, giving security teams a common language for tracking and discussing specific flaws. The CVE system is maintained by the &lt;a href="https://www.cve.org/">MITRE Corporation&lt;/a> and serves as the backbone of modern vulnerability management across the software industry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://sbomify.com/assets/images/d2/cve-lifecycle.svg" alt="CVE lifecycle from discovery through remediation">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-a-cve">What Is a CVE?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>CVE stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. It is a dictionary of publicly disclosed security flaws, each assigned a unique identifier in the format &lt;code>CVE-YEAR-NUMBER&lt;/code> (for example, &lt;code>CVE-2021-44228&lt;/code> for the Log4Shell vulnerability). The CVE system does not rate the severity of vulnerabilities — it simply catalogs them with a standardized reference that anyone in the cybersecurity community can use unambiguously.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The program was launched in 1999 by MITRE Corporation with funding from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/">CISA&lt;/a>). Before CVE existed, different vendors and databases used their own naming schemes for the same vulnerability, leading to confusion and duplicated effort. CVE solved this by providing a single, authoritative numbering system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As of early 2026, the CVE database contains over 330,000 entries and continues to grow rapidly — over 48,000 CVEs were published in 2025 alone. The MITRE CVE program relies on a network of CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs) — organizations authorized to assign CVE IDs within their scope. Major CNAs include Microsoft, Google, Red Hat, Apache, and hundreds of other vendors and open source projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-the-cve-process-works">How the CVE Process Works&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="discovery-and-assignment">Discovery and Assignment&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When a vulnerability is discovered — by a security researcher, vendor, or automated tool — it can be reported to the relevant CNA or directly to MITRE. The CNA evaluates the report and, if it meets the criteria (a security flaw in publicly available software that can be independently fixed), assigns a CVE ID.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="publication">Publication&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Once assigned, the CVE entry is published to the &lt;a href="https://www.cve.org/">CVE List&lt;/a> with a description and references. The entry may initially be marked as &amp;ldquo;reserved&amp;rdquo; while the vendor works on a patch, then updated with full details upon coordinated public disclosure.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="enrichment">Enrichment&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>After publication, the &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/">National Vulnerability Database&lt;/a> (NVD), maintained by NIST, enriches the CVE with additional data: severity scores (via CVSS), affected product configurations (CPE data), and references to patches and advisories. This enrichment makes CVE data actionable for vulnerability management tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cve-vs-cvss-vs-kev-understanding-the-differences">CVE vs. CVSS vs. KEV: Understanding the Differences&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>These three acronyms are related but distinct. Confusing them is common, so here is a clear breakdown.&lt;/p>

&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>A CVE tells you &lt;em>what&lt;/em> the vulnerability is. A &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/02/05/what-is-cvss-vulnerability-scoring/">CVSS&lt;/a> score tells you &lt;em>how bad&lt;/em> it is. A &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2025/12/30/what-is-kev-cisa-known-exploited-vulnerabilities/">KEV&lt;/a> listing tells you &lt;em>it is being actively exploited right now&lt;/em>. Effective vulnerability management uses all three signals together.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-national-vulnerability-database-nvd">The National Vulnerability Database (NVD)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/">National Vulnerability Database&lt;/a> is the U.S. government&amp;rsquo;s repository of standards-based vulnerability management data. NVD builds on the CVE list by adding:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>CVSS scores&lt;/strong> — severity ratings using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>CPE data&lt;/strong> — Common Platform Enumeration entries that map vulnerabilities to specific products and versions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>CWE classifications&lt;/strong> — Common Weakness Enumeration categories describing the type of flaw (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Fix references&lt;/strong> — links to vendor advisories and patches&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>NVD is freely accessible and is the primary data source for most vulnerability scanning tools. When a platform like &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/anchore/grype">Grype&lt;/a>, or &lt;a href="https://dependencytrack.org/">OWASP Dependency-Track&lt;/a> scans your software for known issues, it is typically checking component versions against NVD data.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cve-funding-and-governance">CVE Funding and Governance&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The CVE program has historically been funded through U.S. government contracts administered by CISA and DHS. In 2025, questions about the sustainability of MITRE&amp;rsquo;s CVE funding drew significant attention from the cybersecurity community. The concern was straightforward: the entire global vulnerability tracking ecosystem depends on a single program funded by a single government.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In response, the &lt;a href="https://www.cve.org/">CVE Foundation&lt;/a> was established to diversify funding and governance. The CVE Board, an international group of cybersecurity experts, provides strategic oversight. The expansion of the CNA network — now numbering over 400 organizations across 40+ countries — has also distributed the operational workload beyond MITRE alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Regardless of governance structure, the CVE system remains the de facto global standard for vulnerability identification.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="vulnerability-management-with-cves">Vulnerability Management with CVEs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Vulnerability management is the continuous process of identifying, evaluating, prioritizing, and remediating security flaws in software. CVEs are the fundamental building blocks of this process.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-vulnerability-management-lifecycle">The Vulnerability Management Lifecycle&lt;/h3>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Discover&lt;/strong> — Inventory all software components in your environment (this is where SBOMs are critical)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Identify&lt;/strong> — Match your components against known CVEs using vulnerability scanners&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Evaluate&lt;/strong> — Assess severity using CVSS scores, exploit availability (KEV status), and your own risk context&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Prioritize&lt;/strong> — Not all CVEs require immediate action. Focus on high-severity vulnerabilities in internet-facing or critical systems, especially those listed in the &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">CISA KEV catalog&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Remediate&lt;/strong> — Apply patches, update dependencies, or implement mitigations&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Verify&lt;/strong> — Confirm the fix was applied and re-scan to ensure the vulnerability is resolved&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="vulnerability-scanners-and-scanning-tools">Vulnerability Scanners and Scanning Tools&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Several categories of tools support CVE-based vulnerability management:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/01/11/software-composition-analysis-sca/">Software Composition Analysis (SCA)&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> tools scan open source dependencies for known CVEs. Examples include &lt;a href="https://github.com/anchore/grype">Grype&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://snyk.io/">Snyk&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy">Trivy&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Container scanners&lt;/strong> analyze Docker and OCI images for vulnerable packages. See our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/guides/docker/">Docker SBOM guide&lt;/a> for details.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Network vulnerability scanners&lt;/strong> probe running systems for known flaws.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/2026/02/01/sbom-scanning-vulnerability-detection/">SBOM-based analysis&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> platforms like &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com">sbomify&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://dependencytrack.org/">OWASP Dependency-Track&lt;/a> ingest SBOMs and continuously monitor components against new CVE disclosures.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>See our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/resources/">resources page&lt;/a> for a complete list of vulnerability scanning and SBOM analysis tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The key advantage of SBOM-based scanning is that it decouples vulnerability identification from the build process. Once you have an SBOM, you can re-scan it at any time as new CVEs are published — without needing access to the source code or build system.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-sboms-enable-rapid-cve-response">How SBOMs Enable Rapid CVE Response&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The value of a &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/what-is-sbom/">Software Bill of Materials&lt;/a> becomes most obvious during a vulnerability incident. Consider the Log4Shell scenario (CVE-2021-44228, disclosed December 2021):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Without SBOMs:&lt;/strong> Teams had to manually audit every application, check dependency files, search through build systems, and contact vendors to determine if they were using Apache Log4j. This took many organizations days or weeks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>With SBOMs:&lt;/strong> A simple search across your SBOM repository for &lt;code>org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core&lt;/code> returned a complete list of affected applications in minutes.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This is why compliance frameworks increasingly mandate SBOMs. The &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/eu-cra/">EU Cyber Resilience Act&lt;/a> requires manufacturers to identify and document components in their products. &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/eo-14028/">Executive Order 14028&lt;/a> requires software vendors to the U.S. government to provide SBOMs. The &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/compliance/cisa-minimum-elements/">CISA minimum elements&lt;/a> specify that SBOMs should include unique identifiers (such as &lt;a href="https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec">Package URL&lt;/a>) that can be matched against CVE-affected component data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To start generating SBOMs for your projects, see our &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/guides/">language-specific SBOM guides&lt;/a> covering Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, Rust, and more.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="notable-cves-that-changed-the-industry">Notable CVEs That Changed the Industry&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Several high-profile CVEs have shaped how the industry approaches vulnerability management:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>CVE-2014-0160 (Heartbleed)&lt;/strong> — A critical flaw in OpenSSL that exposed encrypted communications for millions of servers. Highlighted the risk of widely shared dependencies.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>CVE-2017-5638 (Apache Struts)&lt;/strong> — The vulnerability behind the Equifax breach, which exposed personal data of 147 million people. Demonstrated the consequences of slow patching.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell)&lt;/strong> — A remote code execution flaw in Apache Log4j that affected millions of applications. Became the catalyst for widespread SBOM adoption as organizations struggled to identify affected systems.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>CVE-2024-3094 (XZ Utils)&lt;/strong> — A supply chain attack where a malicious contributor inserted a backdoor into the XZ compression library. Showed that vulnerabilities can be deliberately introduced, not just accidentally created.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Each of these incidents reinforced the same lesson: you cannot protect what you cannot see. SBOMs provide that visibility.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="best-practices-for-cve-management">Best Practices for CVE Management&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Maintain SBOMs for all your software.&lt;/strong> An accurate component inventory is the foundation of effective vulnerability management. Use automated tools to &lt;a href="https://sbomify.com/guides/">generate SBOMs&lt;/a> as part of your CI/CD pipeline.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Automate vulnerability scanning.&lt;/strong> Integrate SBOM-based scanning tools into your build and deployment process. Continuous monitoring catches newly disclosed CVEs without manual effort.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Use multiple severity signals.&lt;/strong> Do not rely on CVSS scores alone. Factor in KEV status (is it being exploited?), your deployment context (is the component exposed?), and exploit maturity.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Establish a patching SLA.&lt;/strong> Define response timeframes based on severity. Critical CVEs in exposed systems should be addressed within days, not months.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Subscribe to advisories.&lt;/strong> Monitor the &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds">NVD data feeds&lt;/a>, vendor security bulletins, and the &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">CISA KEV catalog&lt;/a> for timely notification of new CVEs affecting your stack.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Document your response process.&lt;/strong> When the next Log4Shell-scale event happens, you need a practiced runbook — not a scramble. SBOMs, pre-defined escalation paths, and automated alerting make the difference.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="what-does-cve-stand-for">What does CVE stand for?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>CVE stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. It is a system for assigning unique identifiers to publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Each CVE ID (e.g., CVE-2021-44228) serves as a standard reference that security teams, vendors, and tools can use to unambiguously identify a specific flaw.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-a-cve-and-a-vulnerability">What is the difference between a CVE and a vulnerability?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A vulnerability is any security weakness in software that could be exploited. A CVE is the standardized identifier assigned to a publicly known vulnerability. Not all vulnerabilities have CVE IDs — only those that are publicly disclosed and meet the CVE program&amp;rsquo;s inclusion criteria receive a CVE number. Think of CVE as the naming system, and vulnerability as the broader concept.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="who-assigns-cve-numbers">Who assigns CVE numbers?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>CVE IDs are assigned by CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs). MITRE Corporation serves as the primary CNA and coordinates the overall program. Over 400 organizations, including major software vendors like Microsoft, Google, and Red Hat, are authorized to assign CVE IDs within their product scope. Researchers can also request CVE IDs through the &lt;a href="https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/ReportRequest">CVE Request form&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-are-cves-used-in-vulnerability-management">How are CVEs used in vulnerability management?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>CVEs are the foundation of vulnerability management. Organizations use vulnerability scanners and Software Composition Analysis tools to match their software components against known CVEs. When a match is found, the CVSS severity score and KEV status help prioritize remediation. SBOMs make this process more efficient by providing a complete component inventory that can be continuously rescanned.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-the-national-vulnerability-database-nvd">What is the National Vulnerability Database (NVD)?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The NVD is the U.S. government&amp;rsquo;s repository of vulnerability data, maintained by NIST. It enriches CVE entries with severity scores (CVSS), affected product mappings (CPE), weakness classifications (CWE), and references to patches. Most vulnerability scanning tools use NVD as their primary data source.&lt;/p></description><category>education</category></item></channel></rss>
